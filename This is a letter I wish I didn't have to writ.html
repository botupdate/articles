<span><div>This is a letter I wish I didn't have to write.</div><div><br/></div><div>First of all, this is an actual confession. I don't have a lawyer and it's less important that I might be crazy and more important to ask yourself, is what I'm saying true? Trust me, you're going to think I'm crazy. This is not some tactic to get off for reasons of insanity. I could probably do that but like I said, it's less important that you believe I did it than it is to understand what it is I have done. Again, this is an actual confession. I have to get this off of my chest; and to do that, I have to explain a tiny bit of technology for the non-nerds out there. Secondly, what I'm about to tell you is the kind of thing that is going to make you a little jittery. You need to know that nothing has changed on this day and there is no reason to panic.  life doesn't change and it's not like everything is going to break. You may decide to take extreme action and start a mission to populate another; but nothing has changed, I can assure you the world will not function differently today, maybe you're just going to be really pissed off. If you are seeing this, it is likely that I am partly responsible for the hacking of your home cable or DSL modem or router. It is important that the reader understands that I have a well-documented sense of humor and although many people know this, if you're just meeting me you must understand that this is not a joke, this is a confession and an apology; but it is far more important to understand that you are vulnerable. It is my intent to make a video if i have time. Please take this seriously even if humor is my defence mechanism, it must not distract you from the facts. If I helped to hack you it was probably at a music festival or creative event like Burning Man. it could be you walked by me in San Diego or any number of cities I have travelled to in the last couple of years. I love Burning Man, and the only thing I don't like at Burning Man is that it is very difficult to go from a world where you have a powerful, pocket-sized communication device, back to the &quot;meet you at this time and that place  kind of world. I actually do like that Spartan ideal; but, I don't like that other people suck in that world, and that it doesn't have to be that way in order to get the full effect of Burning Man; which is life-changing to say the least. I'm not the only guy who doesn't like this; a lot of the 70,000 people who go there each year don't like it either. For one thing it's a flaky group of really interesting people who have learned to rely on their little devices, as much as they want you to believe they're keeping it Real. We lose contact with loved ones that we want to share special moments with.</div><div>Well we fixed that. For several years now we have seen Mesh Networks in practical application in emergency areas and also at places like Burning Man, Eclipse, Lightning in a Bottle, et al. Burning Man for instance is a situation where 70,000+ people live in a harsh alkali desert (like a salt flat), in roughly 3 mile radius; where people are experimenting with states of being, consciousness and community, plus emergency services personnel must function off grid for roughly three weeks. Basically, everyone's devices are set up to mimic towers and everyone can call anyone in the mesh but not necessarily outside of it, in some cases you can talk outside of it but I don't want to get too technical, I'm just saying it is a known technology I'm fairly certain that we also do this on the battlefield to break or establish secure communications. I got out of the Marine Corps almost 20 years ago after working as a self-taught IT Specialist at the Marine Air Group, before text messaging even became a thing so I don't know if that's something we talk about; either way, we do it at Burning Man, Mesh networks at music festivals and in the world are an actual thing. 'nuff said. it exists and it works.</div><div><br/></div><div>About 6 years ago my computer got hacked. It was brutal. I thought my life was over, it took me two or three years just to figure out how to get this thing off of my computer, it became my non-work project to figure it out and it took almost all of my time. I had been recorded on video unbeknownst to me and then they tried to ransom that video to me. I was not going to let that stop me from sending that to authorities, which I did. no reply. not one agency got back to me and I reported to them all, and a few virus companies. This took a toll on my business; but, I figured if I was making money these guys would just shake me down for it, why bother. but when the combined ideas of a root-kit and a mesh network intermingled with blockchain technology it gave me the idea to create my own mesh network on my routers. I figured It shouldn't take too much work because so many routers have known vulnerabilities, including my own. They have enough ram on board and nobody ever updates or changes their default passwords, and even if they do, there are known exploits and admin passwords so you can just telnet in and change the firmware on the actual chips that are a permanent part of all devices, even your coffee maker has this it is called Firmware because it is difficult to update or change, software is easy, hardware can't be changed at all. when you get a virus at this level it is almost impossible to detect even by experts. Although it had been proven to exist in laboratory conditions as early as 2008, noone could prove it was happening &quot;in the wild&quot; and a few researchers had claimed to find it in 2013 only to be pretty much laughed at by the security community. I know it exists  because I have an infected computer. Look up Dragos Riui for an example here's a link of some of the comments he had to endure. <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/71424/what-happened-with-badbios">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/71424/what-happened-with-badbios</a>  these days it's a known thing and called a BIOS Root-kit and many of them are on your computers and you don't even know about it. That wasn't me, as i said, I got one too; but it took me a couple of years to figure out how to get it off. I'm not that smart but I am persistent. Ask any nerd you know, it's easy. I thought, &quot;I wonder if I can hack the router and rewrite the firmware so that they talk to each other and create a mesh network that doesn't even use the internet, that way, I can create an alternate subnet with my own addresses,&quot; well, I was right and since ATT uses a couple of hundred thousand ARRIS NVG 589 599 routers with known vulnerabilities, I don't even have to write the firmware, only some additional code that references an adhoc DNS system which can actually be virtualized ala p2p now known as blockchain and signed codes with SHA1 which has been compromised but still works. It allows me to telnet or SSL in using the OEM pwd since very few people know how to disable it and let the machine replicate the updating of firmware itself by using a convenient thing called the OTA update! just like your cellphone!&quot; then I thought &quot;Cellphones! that would be a disaster!. but while I hacked my own router and blew a few chips doing it, I accidentally taught it to replicate to my second router not realizing that other routers of the same make were in range. (and you wouldn't believe how fast it worked using block-chain technology to replicate the new DNS of the Mesh network) I didn't even realize it had happened it was so fast. it was about 12 hours. I thought it would take maybe a year but it turns out that nearby devices can help each other out, I hadn't even thought of that myself, that was just an convenient bonus when they can't reach the mothership so to speak. 12 hours cable modem! t gets worse, (I'm not even a computer programmer) I figured this could be done to computers and cellphones which have bluetooth. wifi, NFC etc. and this could be set up using all communications vectors as a hybrid network, even replicating code onto the firmware of TVs, Radios, tablets, you name it. all I had to do was change the packet size and foprmation so that the regular router would see it as a bad packet and just drop it while the rootkit picked it up.</div><div>Now, most of you know me as a professional entertainer but I went to college for computer science and I don't like programming that much but there are so many guys out there that will write you code for cheap. I took VB5 in college and I hated it and in the last couple of years I've been learning Linux but I really didn't have to write any code myself.  Then I was like, I wonder if I can do this on other routers so I looked up &quot;known vulnerabilities&quot; and found out that all I need is the IP address which I can get right from the WIFI of the device broadcasting it to everyone. I realized I didn't even need to know that since most IPs are logical in a series set up by their ISP, so I just had to have the router act like it was the parent or the DNS server, say it was computer 208.67.220.220 and it believed me and took the update because all these certificates are out of date. . bang next was to get Comcast's routers, I kept waiting for someone to figure it out at ATT or COMCAST but nope, I started looking at root-kit and BIOS root-kits for the five most commonly sold laptop, since they move around I bet they hit some of my routers in the mesh. these Rootkit  virus are so hard to get off of your computer. Did you know that you need to actually use sunlight to clear an EEPROM chip? I didn't know that. I thought they were pulling my leg until I tried to get that BIOS root-kit off of my laptop. in some cases there's nothing you can do once root-kit has replaced your BIOS firmware.it's on there forever, you're machine is just compromised, period that's it. So I started to think how dangerous this was and I tried to let the FBI and the NSA know because I didn't want to hurt anyone I was just trying to figure out how to get the internet to work when I was at a festival. But then something happened, or didn't happen I guess you could say. The FBI ignored my tips, so did the NSA, so did the CIA, so did the police, so did even my room-mates who thought I was some crazy dude who spends too much time in my &quot;OFFICE&quot; and to tell you the truth I do spend way too much time in my Office/apartment/area. I mean I spend all of my time there trying to get the FBI to answer the phone. and then a couple of months ago something much worse happened. It wasn't me that had access to all of these routers, it was someone else, and they were not nice people, only they had taken it much farther than I had, [probably because they know what they're doing). they had rewritten firmware to other devices as well, not just routers, which even I admit was easy; but they wrote it into the laptop batteries firmware, bluetooth, wifi, NFC, wrote it in to the cellphones, it was in usb chargers that you could get for cheap on alibaba, even sound cards, using soundcards to transmit ULF comm like an old phone modem, it was also being done with ultra low frequency audio, you know, they way elephants can talk to each other from hundreds of miles away? yeah, that stuff, which means that as long as there was a compromised sound card in the machine, they could talk even if they were &quot;air-gapped&quot; and the only thing you had to do to get &quot;infected&quot; with this new firmware was to connect to any one of my routers. that may sound complicated but I'll make it simple, this software can make your computer LED lights remain off while the computer is on, it can keep the fan from running, the only way you would know it was on is if you did some monitor mode packet sniffing from another machine that was not compromised because my code doesn't let you see itself in the OS there are packets of unusual size and headers so they get dropped by the regular system running the firmware.. just go on your router and watch the dropped packets count.. Now this is a confession but I have to make it clear that I had no intention of ever breaking in to anyone's computers. and I didn't even create this technology, I just did a little research and combined two existing trechnologies, I didn't even go on to the dark web. It's just readily out there, how to do all of this. Now I'm not saying we should delete this, you'd never get rid of my secret ad-hoc mesh network anyway without disconnecting every battery of every computer and router and cellhone and printer at the same time and  even then this code comes back because it's written into the actual chips not your hard drive. you might get the blockchain to stop that way but it'll just make a new one. I was thinking of calling it Davenyet in honor of the Russians because I suspected they were the source; but, Technically I didn't really write any of the code, much smarter people than I did told me I was crazy until I found a guy wthat would do it. So that wouldn't be fair. I started to call it the ALTernet or ALTernyet if you're from that side of the blockchain. Anyway. this is where the story takes a diabolical turn.</div><div><br/></div><div>believe me, If we were hackers and you knew that I was going to release those little nuggets, that would be enough to get me killed, seriously. Snowden didn't even disclose this, although he probably knew it was possible. the ULF thing alone was messing with dragos in 2013 and nobody gave him the time of day! They still aren't admitting that air-gapped machines can get compromised! If this is true and I just let go the secrets that gave you access to 90% of the routers in the USA. That is, if you believed me right now, which I suspect you don't, even though I have the intelligence and the available knowledge, that would be a life threatening situation. I mean look at Snowden, he still has to hideout in weird countries with probably the same guys that came up with this stuff just so he doesn't have to go to jail for saving your dumb asses who left the NSA tools available to anyone who could find an onion.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can imagine what you're thinking, &quot;But Dave, we know you you have pulled publicity stunts before, but this is kind of like yelling fire in a crowded theatre. You love to sing and entertain people, why would you ever want to bring the entire globe to it's knees?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>And the short answer is that this is not a ******** publicity stunt. This is an unintended consequence of my mistake. I'd like to be the guy who can say, I had a Sir Edmund Hilary &quot;I climbed it because it was there&quot; moment but in reality the answer is much more vulgar, I just wanted to watch some adult material and not have to have my ISP monitor and throttle traffic. You may want to disbelieve it but companies like COX cable actually monitor and block traffic like that even if you're paying them $200 a month. I personally know of a veteran's organization which supports homeless vets in My Town which had to restrict these veteran's abilities to search for jobs because (insert local ISP company here) shut them down for downloading &quot;too much&quot; (inappropriate material). I think they might have been (secondary tech disilke) too but needless to say, (favourable group) couldn't look for jobs at a private institution because (local ISP) shut them down. Of course I want to deliver the easy pun here but I'm trying not to, ahh yes I have to write in context: awww let's throw caution to the wind and say what it is, Cox Blocking is what made me want to have an alternate internet, which is where I actually came uip with the term ALTernet.  yeah, that's mine, you can't have it, the ALTernet is a global mesh network which avoids the backbone of the internet by rooting routers and creating a global mesh net. I am truly sorry if I caused you or your family any fear or interrupte4d your service but this is a True Story and I'm sure it has happened many millions of other places. We don't know the impact, you see, COX will give up all of your information to the federal government but they don't feel so good about disclosing WHAT they give to the Feds or who they've blocked. and they shouldn't.. block people I mean, or give up undisclosed information to the federal government. You know the computer can be a weapon too and that would mean it is protected under the first and the second and the fourth and the fifth amendments. I'm not sure if they will tell you which of your neighbours they have shut down. I should be afraid for my life; from people who might misunderstand my intentions, I tried to turn in my computers to the FBI but believe it or not they wouldn't take them. This is an actual confession so let's see if the FBI even calls me... If past performance is an indication future outcomes, I'd say, nope, not gonna happen.</div><div>anyway</div><div>the scope of this has gotten much bigger in 6 years as you may be aware, Kaspersky just announced that the Slingshot malware (their name not mine) I'm sticking to ALTernet  but they're saying that this was an FBI operation which would explain why they never got back to me, but now I'm just so guilty that I feel like I can hear the shameful admonitions of my friends and family I'm even starting to get paranoid where I think I can hear a whistling sound at around 12,000 or 13000 Hz so I recorded it, and yep, it's there. I thought maybe it was Meneirs Disease or Tinitus since I have had some experience with those, a good friend of mine had it and this is not what he described. I've had hearing tests my entire life because I had Bilateral Myringotomies starting at around 7 years old. So I thought my hearing was the problem, and I had it checked and it's still pretty good. so I thought it was maybe my conscience, maybe I have to confess, I had to get it off of my chest and I'm prepared to go to Jail or do whatever I have to do but I have to let you know that 99% of you are vulnerable and already have my malware running on your routers. I'm not sure if it was me that showed the FBI or if they hacked me first but I stole the code from my machine that got hacked.</div><div><br/></div><div>Although I respect hackers and tweakers for the genius that they are in solving puzzles, riddles and surmounting the insurmountable, I'm not affiliated with Shadow Brokers or any of the usual anonymous guys and I'm not going to do this is a Fawkes mask, I'm willing to defend my information. I'm just some guy that figured this out while sitting around in my underwear and probably drinking way too much coffee; but the next level is where this really gets dangerous. You see I was telling you that I could hear the voices of my family pestering me to get right. and for a while there I thought this was a recovery thing, you know like a bunch of smart AA guys get together and decide to figure out how to use the tweaker behaviour against itself and help some of these guys get clean. I was a member in good standing of that organization for many years, lost a few friends and have impacted my family relations with this hacking situation. Then I thought maybe I was a test subject for this and had myself hypnotized to be the guinea pig, or maybe I was in a game show or maybe I could actually hear my neighbours or I could actually hear voices of my family; until I realized something really important, you see, there were a few voices suspiciously absent from the &quot;conversation&quot; and it took me almost 6 months to realize why one of my brothers and my father and my two best friends were absent (security is extremely important to me, as is the constitution and because of that, I've been working in the Cannabis industry and helping to convert grey market business into legitimate business means you have to wipe your phone a lot to keep your friends and business associates from being jeopardized because you happen to like adult material when you're not working. Fortunately for me, I use Signal for phone calls and for texting, which probably explains why I've been hard to reach in the last two years. Unfortunately for me I don't ALWAYS use it for EVERYONE and so I got a chance to listen to a mashup of the greatest hits of my family's conversations from my very own desk in my very own home and was led to believe that they were probably getting the same treatment. Except that I never once heard my father, one of my brothers or anyone else who I communicate with on an encrypted service.</div><div>That has to tell you something. Psychosis doesn't work in conjunction with technological restrictions. Heck for a few hours there I thought maybe Mr. Snowden himself was behind some of this. As a musician, I have a lot of friends and family who are pretty big deals in a variety of industries and many of them are genuinely concerned for my welfare. It is not inconceivable that one of them knows one of him. I respect what he did and hate that he has to hide out because some people say they're worried that he's more dangerous than the people we elect. This note is not about that, needless to say, I'm willing to bet they just don't want you to hear his remaining secrets. Good luck. If I'm ever elected to anything I'll pardon you first thing On the night that Kaspersky revealed the ALTernet, or what still hasn't been revealed really, all of my tech was shut down when I tried tried to call 911. I was pretty scared, you see, I had just seen kaspersky's article and it was written rather amateurishly with an emphasis on &quot;only a hundred people have been infected&quot; and I thought that was a curated news-piece just for me, because after all I know they had the capability to do that, later I discovered Wolfram Mathematica which seems to be designed for this exact purpose they call it &quot;Curated News&quot; and Donald Trump calls it &quot;Fake News&quot; which is much more than just your innocent facebook feed refeeding you the same information this actually sits on my computer under the OS and replaces keywords with other keywords, basically it's like mad libs for news articles and you can get any article to be about eny subject ifyou just know a few important things about a person like political affiliation, family members, significant likes and dislikes and this program is now included in stock Raspberry Pi iso builds. which your kid is most likely using at school to make a roku so it can feed you media too. lots of people are getting them at home because it's 30 bucks and the parents usually listen to their kids' techie talk with amused bewilderment... </div><div>knowing this a couple of weeks ago, I stood in my apartment; my phones just went down, could not call 911, listening to recordings of my family yelling at me, pitying me and telling me not to tell authorities. which politely stopped the second police actually did get there.</div><div>That night, after several hours of trying unsuccessfully to call 911 (yes HOURS trying to dial out or get a message to police) I was able to get a 911 call out, when the police arrived they handcuffed me immediately, searched my house without my permission and took my safes where my guns were secured and unloaded, took my ammunition and they dropped me off to the County Mental Health where a psychiatrist listened to my story and said , you'll be out in a couple of hours we just have to process you. You seem coherent, lucid and you have given a perfectly reasonable situation of how this could occur. 24 hours later I was in 2 south where I met a patient who was doing to someone else, exactly what had been done to me. Literally, that actually happened. They had the victim and the suspect in the same ward and calling them both crazy. I swear I couldn't have made this up and I'm a writer! I felt like I had been drugged and trust me I KNOW what drugged feels like. and I had to beg them to take a urine sample while one of the nurses nervously tried to look busy. The nurse gave me a cup with a broken seal on it. I couldn't believe it. They still did nothing about the problem which by the way is not my mental state. The entire time I was in the ward computers were going down left and right and not one time did I hear the voice of a family member. My mental state was described by my attending psychiatrist Dr. Rao as &quot;very lucid and surprisingly broad in it's range of external considerations. Cogent was used and a few other adjectives which apparently still are grounds to keep you in &quot;observation&quot; without a trial, without opportunity for bail or due process or access to your personal property like a phone. By the way, and my recovery brethren can attest to this and some of those patients are masquerading as nurses. That's a heavy accusation which I can support. But you see I can't do that and this at the same time because my testimony about the ALTernet was met with amused technical bewilderment and a &quot;suggestion&quot; that if I accepted treatment &quot;voluntarily&quot; meaning &quot;anti-psychotic drugs&quot; they would release me from involuntary observation &quot;early.&quot; because I obviously wasn't a danger to myself or others and that the gun things was for my protection but I still haven't gotten them back, in fact, I have to go to a trial now in order to get back the guns that police kinda &quot;stole&quot; from me just because I called 911. They had to search, I had to tell them where my safes were. they were not loaded, ammunition and weapons were in separate safes and they took them without any reason, because I must have sounded like 100,000 other phone calls they get each year about viruses and routers. I know cause that's how many are still vulnerable, probably triple that and that's just the routers and cable and DSL modems. I tried everything to get out of there, even called senators that I know, even called my Dad, To this my he replied, &quot;Good, it sounds to me like that's a good place for you.&quot; and he went to school for computer science too!</div><div>So, I'm confessing, it's the only way I can keep you  guys safe from something that I didn't even start but still have evidence of. But since I already went to the FBI in person with the evidence which they wouldn't even take, I figured out the deal because it came out in an article in ARS technica that &quot;Slingshot&quot; AKA my ALTernet was a part of a huge FBI operation in some foreign country like africa but what they are not telling you is that they have access to every stock router, modem or cellphone besides a few, right down at the machine layer and some of you might be saying &quot;OK We're the good guys!&quot; But as our friend mr snowden pointed out a few years ago, our guys don't hold on to secret information too good. and combining these tools which are known to have been leaked and are in 1 million new viruses per day, (I couldn't believe that either but it's actually more than that now) it might be 2 million now, combined with irresponsible Artificial Intelligence research, fully automated and replicating 3d printers and instant access to everything, with a scoffing (at best) view of the people trying to warn us like Elon Musk, and you have what just happened to me today. I was laughed at by a close friend right after my phone turned off. I've been trying to get my band together fo0r an event this Sunday. that's what I'm doing after I post this. Because even in times like this, you gotta get to the gig.</div><div><br/></div><div>Now after you scoff yourself, because I know you just did, ask yourself ONE question: Is this possible?  If you don't know, I'll tell you. The answer is Yes, and not just possible but eventual, and if not imminent, then likely already we could have a ghost in the bash with root privileges who is trying to desperately learn our language to decide if we are worth keeping around for old time's sake and because we haven't quite tipped the point into not being able to pull the plug.</div><div>and I bet you don't believe me, because in order to believe me you'd have to do something about it. Wouldn't you? You'd have to do something that no computer generated data would expect because it wasn't in your best interests.</div><div><br/></div><div>You'd have to confess to a crime you didn't commit.</div><div><br/></div><div>the problem is I wasn't fast enough because I wasn't believable enough and I'm sorry about that. but you have to ask yourself that next question: which is, &quot;what can I do about it?&quot; and just to prove a point so I don't feel guilty about it any more, I'm willing to bet my freedom that you can't do anything about it. We are at the end of an era, what that is I don't know but I had a part in it because I couldn't do what you can't do either. You can't stop it. But I really wish you had the balls to try. Because if you can't stop it, we all lose our freedom. And it is as simple as believing it is possible. that's all you gotta do. Believe it enough to send this email to someone you care about, or want to piss off, or want to confuse or want to help fix it because I'm not crazy, ask anyone I know, except for that male nurse at County Medical who gave me a &quot;multi-vitamin&quot; when they brought me in from trying to call the police.</div><div><br/></div><div>or you could believe that I've gone crazy, maybe paranoia, drug induced or natural, does it matter? no it doesn't because either way you're' going to click next or swipe right or swipe &quot;later&quot; and say to yourself, maybe I should have said something. Maybe we should hold off a second on this AI thing until we figure out how to stop 2 million new strains of computer viruses a day from generating a million more...</div><div>Or maybe Dave's just being Dave, really smart, really funny, nice guy but probably belongs in a nut house for homeless veterans that the next Republican Governor of California wants to set up...</div><div>or maybe the FBI will get around to talking to dave and find out that he was just doing a publicity stunt.</div><div>For the last time, this is no publicity stunt, well actually it is a publicity stunt but not to save my career. My career is over, I confess, the words I need to get out to the public are, you may have already been pwned it may be too late. Hell I was hoping it was just a prank that Dr. Hawking decided to pull after his death on the human race. He had to have thought of this long before I did. I'm smart but I'm not Sheldon Cooper smart. I was hoping; but, even after taking their &quot;medicine&quot; different doses, in conjunction with doctors orders and even a few other experiments I tried which I will disclose to my doctor if he ever calls me back, I still haven't heard back from the &quot;Team&quot; of doctors in the psych ward, went back to the hospital, a psychiatric nurse cancelled my appointments, she doesn't reply in text, they don't do that at the VA...  They seem to be too busy finding creative ways to disarm our Veterans just long enough to keep pit plugged in.</div><div>I can't do this alone. I need your help, spread the word. the technology exists plus a lot more that I just don;t have the time to explain tonight. if you have to, say, &quot;My crazy friend Dave always sends me stuff like this; but it won't be true because I never send spam to people, not one time in almost 20 years have I ever sent spam, although some of my newsletters may have gotten a little on the hard sales side, I only ever sent my writing and the schedule to my shows. I am not anonymous. I'm me and I approve this message.</div><div>Thanks for your time, I know you guys are really busy and this was a long one.</div><div>I have a gig on Saturday and Sunday, but they're for a ticketed event. I don'[t realy feel like singing much these days. These will probably be my last gig unless you can save the world before then. I think I'm goign to focus on writing and helping people break free from our oppressive government and the iron grip of technology.</div><div>I might do a few other searches too, just sayin.</div><div>gotta keep it real.</div></span>
