<div><span><div>I believe that most people have a healthy rational fear that another person who has the right to do something or when given Authority either moral or legal to exercise a right will eventually do so and the only thing I would disagree with is that or I would add is that this is only true when the right is to the benefit of the person exercising it end the easiest path because I mean you might find this strange but in the case of the actual Act of exercising most people don't do that and I would argue that this is true in 98% of people and don't get all high-and-mighty because even if it were only true and 52% of people the odds are still that you are not one of those morally upright or whatever the opposite that is</div><div><br/></div><div>So if I told you you can increase your lifespan by 20% increase your Quality of Life by 20% and you could accomplish these goals very simply by doing something that was enjoyable to you while doing it and after doing it and you would even look forward to it once you gotten it into your routine and yet most people don't and mutton most people that I run into or walk into do not exercise even though it means an increased quality of life and quantity of life and I would also add that it is my opinion that until humans have gotten to a point where the only thing that is of Great Value is personal health we will not C Health Care as a priority. Especially if there is this glorification of the Rebel the glorification of the what doesn't kill me makes me stronger kind of a mentality the smoking is cool mentality that well I can't have you know a totally healthy life cuz then I would be boring kind of mentality mentality I mean it'll be a priority for some people but until the value of the time we have on Earth as humans is a recognized commodity we won't have the possibility of real reform or real strides in healthcare so I think what's going to have to happen is once money is no longer important once property what's all these things your needs are taken for even needs are taken care of even no longer scares know the possibility of scares when people start to realize that the only thing that they really have the time they're here and this might include religion you know I mean some people are seeking the final reward which by the way is death you can look at it anyway you want to but the final reward is death and as long as you get a reward after death and your life is not as important your time here it's not as important I mean think about it you don't mind killing some guy because you did something bad right because God's going to sort it out I mean is that how it goes or you just surely removing this guy from society because he's that much of a danger cannot be rehabilitated and got has nothing to do with it? Look at look at livestock pet Steven I feel like we're missing something really really really big we are missing life is valuable if you believe in reincarnation this constant Rejuvenation of Soul or the progress of the journey or whatever I think that doesn't necessarily rule out the value of your time here today because it's butt you still lack of sense of So if I told you you can increase your life span by 20% increase the quality of life by 20% and you could compass these goes very simply by doing something that was enjoyable to you while doing it and after doing it and you would even look forward to it once you gotten it into your routine and yet most people don't in mind most people that I run into or walk in to do not exercise even though it means on increase quality of life and quantity of life and I would also add that it is my opinion that until humans have gotten to a point where the only thing that is of great value is personal help we uwill not see healthcare as a priority especially if they're is this Laura vacation of the rebel the glory vacation of the with doesn't kill me makes me stronger kind of a mentality the smoking is cool mentality the well I can't have it all totally healthy life but then I would be boring kind of mentality what it was mentality get healthcare will not be a prior you I mean it will be a priority for some people but I chilled of value of the time we have on earth as humans is a recognize commodity we won't have the possibility of real reform or real drive and healthcare so I think was going to have to happen is once money is no longer important ones property what's all these things your your needs are taking for even needs our taking care of even know longer scare know the possibility of scared. How do I get it until this time until we recognize that life all life not just human life is of supreme value and of limited quantities until we have really and body that so we really have that down healthcare will not be what it really could be I mean we could be immortal does not by any stretch of the imagination impossible we could rejuvenate cells we could enhance our own DNA even while living this is not science fiction this is maybe science future but within our lifetime well most of the lifetimes of the people probably that are reading this it will be possible and what will we do about that I mean if immortality is cheap evil so what do we need God for or heaven or whatever I mean to be quite honest with you most of the people who are trying to get into heaven make it the kind of place that if populated buy them I really wouldn't want to spend an eternity I may have you met some of the people who are claiming that not only a but the rest of their family and friends have a place in heaven I met some of them I have and well I hope that they have progressed a lot more before they get there because other way. Still has his work that out in my opinion but I'm probably would passing on the haven't thing anyway so you know you'll have to find me somewhere else I'm pretty sure that my email in heaven will be the same as it is here you can reach me at David patron at gmail.com or if its something of a more personal nature you could be sweet David be Williams Jr at gmail.com and I've also future secured all of my crotch in nice emails just in case they would want to use David be Williams 3:45 Sunday night and you know I figured going to have to email probably by the sports a duration of me especially since there hasn't even been there a next of me yet</div><div><br/></div><div> But that's not what I really wanted to talk about what I find interesting is that this dichotomy of having in and got and how it decreases your quality of life today you may get a lot of fulfillment from God but I could be argued that it's just service that you're doing and that service you know you're dedicated to how many levels and you reap the benefits of service in Venice benefits of Service Long by religious non religious spiritual non spiritual people forever I mean if you doubt this or you're out here listening to me and you're saying well I insist that you get out there and be of service and get a personal experience with what that does for you because it is well known and documented and touted that service of others is really the point and so if your religious I would argue that you might just be feeling the benefits of service which is I think a universal truth some what I mean seeing that you have positive impact on another person is one of the most powerfully moving experiences I can urge you to experience I have been on the other side of the spectrum I have received service I'm assuming you guys are thinking I was going to say something I was going to discuss how satisfying negative impact on someone on someone who deserves it I'm not going to argue with you having an impact on another person or thing is satisfying no matter which way you slice it semicolon however, and that is for most people about as good as it gets now if you are a sociopath or a psychopath or and you don't feel that guilt when being an impact in anyway or you don't feel the guilt when it's negative or to feel the guilt when it's positive those might be Divergent and it may be a good way to explain that some people I don't know that it would help but you know it might help to place them in boxes before they go into jail cells where they put other people into boxes.</div><div><br/></div><div> But back to the God thing I'm no scientist so I'm about to oversimplify something and some of you probably are scientists and I expect you expand on this team but I am a writer so I do expect a little credit but please throw my name in there on the thesis somewhere where I mean I could I could use a little credit I've had bad credit my entire life and it's only become important to me. But what I'm saying is a thing on either side of an equation by the side of the equal sign like x equals x of course but x equals minus X cancels X Out something like that so looking at God and God is our God isn't he kind of has no bearing on the equation you know God cancels himself he is the innocent bystander and he is the guilty bystander I mean if you look at what a God is this one God All-Seeing all-knowing all-pervading all violating of my privacy God this guy is on both sides of the equation God cancels himself out and I would argue that your happiness your sadness your state of being as Natalie independent of God. </div><div>
            </div><div> and I really want to make sure that we're talking about the same entity here okay because I think we've gotten a little twisted on this so if there's one otrue God and you believe in monotheism the only one and that one he controls everything he has all the power to it she allows us to feel interact with experience Etc if I believe in the one powerful all true all knowing all the violating my privacy but judging benevolently in the end God. If I believe in this B and I call him God and and you believe in a being who is the same thing on the you call him something else and then you insist that he insists that we deal with each other in some way that has ties to your cultural etymology or your anthropology okay I get that makes sense to me but if but if we're talking about this one true entity that is basically in control of everything and he knows what's happening and he is in charge on quote them whether you call him Yahweh and Bob called him allah,  and I call him Krishna and someone else's died yeah but it's really Vishnu and I say how but it's really Krishna I think I could be wrong but if we were all talking about the one and we're all talking about the same entity and it would stand to reason that bringing your anthropological backgrounds into his opinion is shall we say incorrect you notice that I didn't say Buddha you notice that I didn't say Jesus you notice I didn't say aliens and you notice I didn't say Satan or Horus or Kronos and there's a good reason for that because of their own admission and of their followers they came from somewhere else they are not the one the one can still exist and all of the others can exist Jesus can exist how many religions have the concept of the the triumvirate the trilogy the three parts of the whole so I'm I'm reluctant to get into that whole thing and how it applies to the human makeup you know the real the unreal and the conceptual the conceptual. The two sides of creation plus the creation.,  like I said it makes sense to me but it doesn't really matter in the context of the conversation we're discussing the one, the power, the Alpha and the Omega that is to say not just the evil and not just the good but the construct which contains them both not just the first and then the rest but that which contains them all. And this is where most religions lose me okay some have to Trinity some dumb but very frequently they have this all-knowing All-Seeing all-powerful being, who for whatever reasons and there are many, she is opposed by another very powerful force sometimes equally as powerful and in most cases which he himself created and here's the part I don't get if it's a battle and there's an opposition and he gives the power to the opposition it's not really real now is it? Couldn't he just stopped giving him the power I mean some of you could argue that you're experiencing this duality in your own lives where you have seemingly some power over an activity or group of smaller genetic reproductions of yourselves.  but it's not really comprable now is it I mean we're talking about God here we're not talking about you know arbitrary Because I Said So type regulations we're talking about the power as in capital T capital P the power said with James Earl Jones voice all caps the power.  and I really like what Christina has to say about this in the Bhagavad Gita when he says yes there are certain deities and if you have a object if your Abby scences a goal so to speak then you can relay your requests your desires your opinions to them directly but make no mistake that their powers granted threw me all power is granted to me so if you really want to know if power comes from it's here m  in as much as I hate to apply logic to and this theme of God giving power to those who requested or demanded even is a recurring theme and it is it exist across all cultures even when it makes fun of it. </div><div>8 see a comic strip where some schoolmarm is saying God helps those who help themselves and then Buddha counters with but what help does a god need</div></span>
