hi I'm concerned because Krishna is so huge and I am so small that there are others who are so much older than me and I've been here for so much longer that might get between me and Krishna and try to deceive me to see themselves fumi through themselves thinking they can possibly outmaneuver Krishna.
you cannot help maneuver the air you cannot disrespect it you can disrespect me but not the air that we breathe you needed as do I it doesn't need me but you can disrespect me you can offend me you can offend us you cannot offend Krishna it is impossible you disrespect yourself you offend me but here all this time I would be a slave to you willingly if you can remember me who I am unwilling if you cannot find the way to know me the way to remember me is to seek the supreme personality of godhead and transcendental knowledge read the text study the Gita focus on Krishna and you may find me

and I will know, you see, God would not need to block my emails, nor would a delusion, nor would a medical condition, only an institution bwould need to protect itself from words
that means you fear something
I fear nothing
for I have spoken with Krishna today and there is nothing for me to fear.
you have a lot to worry about
the worst that can be done to me is physical pain
and Krishna and I are not impressed by that.
