Applicant must respond timely and completely to the issues below. 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(a), 2.65(a); TMEP §§711, 718.03.</div><div><br/></div><div>The trademark examining attorney has searched the Office’s database of registered and pending marks and has found no conflicting marks that would bar registration under Trademark Act Section 2(d). TMEP §704.02; see 15 U.S.C. §1052(d).</div><div><br/></div><div>SUMMARY OF ISSUES:</div><div>- Failure to Function Refusal: Title of a Single Work</div><div>- Inquiry: Name of an Individual</div><div>- Specimen Merely A Rendering of the Mark</div><div>- Disclaimer Required</div><div>- Description of Mark Amendment Required</div><div><br/></div><div>FAILURE TO FUNCTION REFUSAL: TITLE OF A SINGLE WORK</div><div><br/></div><div>Registration is refused because the applied-for mark, as used on the specimen of record (1) is used only as the title of a single creative work, namely, the title of a single book; and (2) does not function as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to identify and distinguish them from others. Trademark Act Sections 1, 2, and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051-1052, 1127; see Herbko Int’l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1162-63, 64 USPQ2d 1375, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2002); TMEP §§904.07(b), 1202.08.</div><div><br/></div><div>In this case, the submitted specimen shows the applied-for mark, a design featuring the wording “#napkin diaries --david patrone”, which the application describes as the front cover of a book. As no other wording appears in the specimen, such use would be perceived only as the title of a single book. There is no evidence in the application record that applicant offers any other works in commerce under the mark, nor are there specimens or evidence in the record otherwise showing proper trademark use of the applied-for mark for the identified goods.</div><div><br/></div><div>Therefore, consumers would view the applied-for mark as the title of a single work, rather than as a trademark to indicate the source of applicant’s goods and to distinguish applicant’s goods from others.</div><div><br/></div><div>In appropriate circumstances, applicant may overcome this refusal by satisfying one of the following options:</div><div><br/></div><div>(1) Submit evidence that the applied-for mark is used to identify a series of creative works.</div><div><br/></div><div>(2) Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b). This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>For an overview of both response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy each option online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, please go to http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/law/title_single_work.jsp.</div><div><br/></div><div>INQUIRY: NAME OF AN INDIVIDUAL</div><div><br/></div><div>Applicant must clarify whether the name “David Patrone” in the mark identifies a particular living individual. See 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b); TMEP §§813, 1206.03. In this case, the application neither specifies whether the name in the mark identifies a particular living individual nor includes a written consent. See TMEP §§813.01(a)-(b), 1206.04(a), 1206.05.</div><div><br/></div><div>To register a mark that consists of or comprises the name of a particular living individual, including a first name, pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, an applicant must provide a written consent personally signed by the named individual. 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813, 1206.04(a).</div><div><br/></div><div>Accordingly, if the name in the mark does not identify a particular living individual, applicant must submit a statement to that effect (e.g., “The name shown in the mark does not identify a particular living individual.”).</div><div><br/></div><div>However, if the name in the mark does identify a particular living individual, applicant must submit both of the following:</div><div><br/></div><div>(1) The following statement: “The name(s) shown in the mark identifies a living individual(s) whose consent(s) to register is made of record.” If the name is a pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, applicant must provide the following statement: “David Patrone identifies David B. Williams, Jr., a living individual whose consent is of record.”</div><div><br/></div><div>(2) A written consent, personally signed by the named individual(s), as follows: “I, David B. Williams Jr., consent to the use and registration of my name, David Patrone, as a trademark and/or service mark with the USPTO.”</div><div><br/></div><div>For an overview of the requirements pertaining to names appearing in marks, and instructions on how to satisfy this requirement online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, please go to http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/law/consent.jsp.</div><div><br/></div><div>Failing to respond to this inquiry may result in a refusal to register the mark. See In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc., 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008); TMEP §814.</div><div><br/></div><div>SPECIMEN MERELY A RENDERING OF THE MARK</div><div><br/></div><div>Registration is refused because the specimen in International Class 16 is merely a rendering of the applied-for mark, and thus fails to show the applied-for mark in use in commerce with the goods and/or services for each international class. Trademark Act Sections 1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127; 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); In re Chica, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (TTAB 2007); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a), 1301.04(g)(i). An application based on Trademark Act Section 1(a) must include a specimen showing the applied-for mark in use in commerce for each international class of goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(1); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(1)(iv), 2.56(a); TMEP §§904, 904.07(a).</div><div><br/></div><div>Examples of specimens for goods include tags, labels, instruction manuals, containers, photographs that show the mark on the actual goods or packaging, and displays associated with the actual goods at their point of sale. See TMEP §§904.03 et seq. Webpages may also be specimens for goods when they include a picture or textual description of the goods associated with the mark and the means to order the goods. TMEP §904.03(i).</div><div><br/></div><div>Applicant may respond to this refusal by satisfying one of the following for each applicable international class:</div><div><br/></div><div>(1) Submit a different specimen (a verified “substitute” specimen) that (a) was in actual use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of an amendment to allege use and (b) shows the mark in actual use in commerce for the goods and/or services identified in the application or amendment to allege use. A “verified substitute specimen” is a specimen that is accompanied by the following statement made in a signed affidavit or supported by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20: “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application or prior to the filing of the amendment to allege use.” The substitute specimen cannot be accepted without this statement.</div><div><br/></div><div>(2) Amend the filing basis to intent to use under Section 1(b), for which no specimen is required. This option will later necessitate additional fee(s) and filing requirements such as providing a specimen.</div><div><br/></div><div>For an overview of both response options referenced above and instructions on how to satisfy either option online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, please go to http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/law/specimen.jsp.</div><div><br/></div><div>To submit a verified specimen or verified substitute specimen online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) response form, (1) answer “Yes” to form wizard question #2; and then, continuing on to the next portion of the form, under the heading “Classification and Listing of Goods/Services/Collective Membership Organization,” do the following for each relevant class for which a specimen is being submitted: (2) check the box next to the following statement: “Check here to modify the current classification number; listing of goods/services/the nature of the collective membership organization; dates of use; and/or filing basis; or to submit a substitute specimen, a foreign registration certificate, or proof of renewal of a foreign registration. If not checked, the changes will be ignored.”; (3) under “Specimen File,” attach a specimen (attachment may not exceed 5 megabytes); (4) describe in the box below where you attached the file what the specimen consists of; and (5) check the box next to the following statement below the specimen description (to ensure that the declaration language is inserted into the form): “The substitute (or new, or originally submitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application.” Additionally, when submitting a verified specimen, the TEAS online form requires two signatures: one in the “Declaration Signature” section and one in the “Response Signature” section.</div><div><br/></div><div>DESCRIPTION OF MARK AMENDEMENT REQUIRED</div><div><br/></div><div>The description of the mark is inaccurate because it states the mark consists of two words that may appear either as two words or one while the drawing depicts the words as separate. The description of the mark is also incomplete because it does not describe all the significant aspects of the applied-for mark. Applications for marks not in standard characters must include an accurate and concise description of the entire mark that identifies literal elements as well as any design elements. See 37 C.F.R. §2.37; TMEP §§808.02, 808.03(d).</div><div><br/></div><div>Therefore, applicant must provide a more accurate description of the applied-for mark. The following is suggested:</div><div><br/></div><div>The mark consists of the wording “#napkin diaries --david patrone” typed on a textured background resembling a portion of a napkin.</div><div><br/></div><div>DISCLAIMER REQUIRED</div><div><br/></div><div>Applicant must disclaim the wording “DIARIES” because it merely describes the format or style applicant’s goods and thus is an unregistrable component of the mark. See 15 U.S.C. §§1052(e)(1), 1056(a); DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd., 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting In re Oppedahl &amp; Larson LLP, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); TMEP §§1213, 1213.03(a).</div><div><br/></div><div>The attached dictionary evidence shows this wording means “a record of events, transactions, or observations kept daily or at frequent intervals,” or “a daily record of personal activities, reflections or feelings.” Additionally, the attached article from the San Diego Reader quotes applicant as explaining that the Napkin Diaries project consists of poems that are “on all sorts of topics. I mean, there’s no real category. It’s just all the random stuff I think of in a day …” Therefore, the wording merely describes the nature of applicant’s goods.</div><div><br/></div><div>An applicant may not claim exclusive rights to terms that others may need to use to describe their goods and/or services in the marketplace. See Dena Corp. v. Belvedere Int’l, Inc., 950 F.2d 1555, 1560, 21 USPQ2d 1047, 1051 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re Aug. Storck KG, 218 USPQ 823, 825 (TTAB 1983). A disclaimer of unregistrable matter does not affect the appearance of the mark; that is, a disclaimer does not physically remove the disclaimed matter from the mark. See Schwarzkopf v. John H. Breck, Inc., 340 F.2d 978, 978, 144 USPQ 433, 433 (C.C.P.A. 1965); TMEP §1213.</div><div><br/></div><div>If applicant does not provide the required disclaimer, the USPTO may refuse to register the entire mark. See In re Stereotaxis Inc., 429 F.3d 1039, 1040-41, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1088-89 (Fed. Cir. 2005); TMEP §1213.01(b).</div><div><br/></div><div>Applicant should submit a disclaimer in the following standardized format:</div><div><br/></div><div>No claim is made to the exclusive right to use “DIARIES” apart from the mark as shown.</div><div><br/></div><div>For an overview of disclaimers and instructions on how to satisfy this disclaimer requirement online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) form, please go to http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/law/disclaimer.jsp.</div><div><br/></div><div>RESPONSE GUIDELINES</div><div><br/></div><div>Because of the legal technicalities and strict deadlines involved in the USPTO application process, applicant may wish to hire a private attorney specializing in trademark matters to represent applicant in this process and provide legal advice. Although the undersigned trademark examining attorney is permitted to help an applicant understand the contents of an Office action as well as the application process in general, no USPTO attorney or staff is permitted to give an applicant legal advice or statements about an applicant’s legal rights. TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.</div><div><br/></div><div>For attorney referral information, applicant may consult the American Bar Association’s Consumers’ Guide to Legal Help, an attorney referral service of a state or local bar association, or a local telephone directory. The USPTO may not assist an applicant in the selection of a private attorney. 37 C.F.R. §2.11.</div><div><br/></div><div>For this application to proceed further, applicant must explicitly address each refusal and/or requirement raised in this Office action. If the action includes a refusal, applicant may provide arguments and/or evidence as to why the refusal should be withdrawn and the mark should register. Applicant may also have other options for responding to a refusal and should consider such options carefully. To respond to requirements and certain refusal response options, applicant should set forth in writing the required changes or statements. For more information and general tips on responding to USPTO Office actions, response options, and how to file a response online, see “Responding to Office Actions” on the USPTO’s website.</div><div><br/></div><div>If applicant does not respond to this Office action within six months of the issue/mailing date, or responds by expressly abandoning the application, the application process will end and the trademark will fail to register. See 15 U.S.C. §1062(b); 37 C.F.R. §§2.65(a), 2.68(a); TMEP §§718.01, 718.02. Additionally, the USPTO will not refund the application filing fee, which is a required processing fee. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(i)-(iv), 2.209(a); TMEP §405.04.</div><div><br/></div><div>Where the application has been abandoned for failure to respond to an Office action, applicant’s only option would be to file a timely petition to revive the application, which, if granted, would allow the application to return to active status. See 37 C.F.R. §2.66; TMEP §1714. There is a $100 fee for such petitions. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.6, 2.66(b)(1).</div><div><br/></div><div>If applicant has questions regarding this Office action, please telephone or e-mail the assigned trademark examining attorney. All relevant e-mail communications will be placed in the official application record; however, an e-mail communication will not be accepted as a response to this Office action and will not extend the deadline for filing a proper response. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.62(c), 2.191; TMEP §§304.01-.02, 709.04-.05. Further, although the trademark examining attorney may provide additional explanation pertaining to the refusal(s) and/or requirement(s) in this Office action, the trademark examining attorney may not provide legal advice or statements about applicant’s rights. See TMEP §§705.02, 709.06.</div><div><br/></div><div>TEAS PLUS OR TEAS REDUCED FEE (TEAS RF) APPLICANTS – TO MAINTAIN LOWER FEE, ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET, INCLUDING SUBMITTING DOCUMENTS ONLINE: Applicants who filed their application online using the lower-fee TEAS Plus or TEAS RF application form must (1) file certain documents online using TEAS, including responses to Office actions (see TMEP §§819.02(b), 820.02(b) for a complete list of these documents); (2) maintain a valid e-mail correspondence address; and (3) agree to receive correspondence from the USPTO by e-mail throughout the prosecution of the application. See 37 C.F.R. §§2.22(b), 2.23(b); TMEP §§819, 820. TEAS Plus or TEAS RF applicants who do not meet these requirements must submit an additional processing fee of $50 per international class of goods and/or services. 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(v), 2.22(c), 2.23(c); TMEP §§819.04, 820.04. However, in certain situations, TEAS Plus or TEAS RF applicants may respond to an Office action by authorizing an examiner’s amendment by telephone or e-mail without incurring this additional fee.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>John C.
