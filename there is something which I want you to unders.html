<span><div><span>there is something which I want you to understand, all of you, if you haven't figured it out already, the big cancer in our society is not drugs or wht the use of drugs does to someone, the cancer is from the war on illegal rugs. you see, you have been so indoctrinated by the people who no wait stop just fucking stop! all of that rhetoric in your head right now and the judging I need you to take a look at it , seriously, where does it come from?  What is your personal experience with the drugs?  You have to think rationally about this and hat is all I'm asking oif you to give me a few minutes, a man who has an EXTENSIVE experience with just about every illegal drug in the united states. A person who has an expremely high intelligence !uotent, that is not to say that he's a genius just that h scores very well on one particual type of test, an Intelligence test.</span></div><div><span>I only point that out so that you don't make the mistake of disregarding the last 20 years I have sepnt doing first-person research on an idea that wsa presented to me around that time.</span></div><div><span>this is the idea that the actual War on drugs is the problem, that prohibition as imposed by governments is unhealthy for society as a whole and at the individual level.  Now, I thought that was pretty ridiculous when I heard that.</span></div><div><span>maybe some of you do to.  Maybe some of you are like, how did this MF get in here? why is he talking to us and do you think he has any drugs on him right now?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span>paper. anyway, I still think it was damn good for a 17 year old. and I was already enlistend in the Marines when I wrote it.</span></div><div><span>so, just hear me out for a second.  I have served his country, 10 years as a United States Marine. I signed my papers just after my 17th birthday and before some whackjob named Saddam Hussein dropped nerve gas on a small village named Halabja in an efford to extinguish the Kurrds.  I know this because Chemical and Biological weapons was the subject of my very first Term Paper in 1988 and that incident was the most recent use of nerve Gas at that time. The introduction to my term paper was so graphic that my teacher, Mrs. Dunn actually took off oints for describing how I imagined is must have been like for a mother to try and save her child as they both experienced the effects of Sarin Gas. These days I probably would have gotten an awrd for writing like that but her remarks were simply, shit I can't find it. anyway it was something about the dramatic portrayal taking away from the  messagof the paper</span></div><div><span>  and althought I wasn't diffusing IEDs or running into a hot urban labrynth in Kabul, I did serve in combat as an Aviation Explosives Technician and I have been shot at once or twice and I lost a couple of close Marines incuding my best friend who diesd in my arms at 19. I also most definitley am engaged in what many of you have labeled as PTSD although i warn you that I believe nearly every human has some form of that and it's called living on life's terms. Now I neeed you to hold on to that one for a minute. I can already hear what I think is you yelling and screaming at what I think is another person about why they should lock me up. Now I know that these people aren't real but there is a prtof me that constantly wonders if the neighbors arent't really arguing about the writer in the aprtment mext door who stay up all fucking night and why doesnt that asshole just get a fucking job and this worthless mother fucker living on the government dole and fucking acting like he's so fucking special and shit, maybe he should just get a recular fucking job what the fuck?? motherfucker probably has surveillance cameras and speakers and shit in his apartment, igyfsohasfpoiunsuhp some     blah blah blah, and then I heard shit talking about the marine corps for a minute and then you know.  so Imabing this but I don't imagine the slamming of a door. that's real, and maybe the TV has some argument going on at the time but the thing is, that door slam was real, just like you people are in front of me, even if the things I imagine youare saying and thinking are not.</span></div><div><span>for many years I have dealt with what I believe to have been cause by a coupl of years of sleep deprivation, I have sleep Deprivation Psychosis, which normally isn't a big deal, I mean we all think wew hear in the static a little thing like our name or any numbe rof other things that we may be interested and keying into at any partiicular time.  so I had to look at this and wonder, wwre these argument real and about something other than me or wre they real and actually about me or was I making up the entire thing, ecept for of course the slamming door.  It has been an interesting journey, and by interesting I mean harrowing because the psychosis is intensified when there are stakes on the line, when there is something dangerous or </span></div><div><span>potentioally harmful in my immediate future, such as the presence of a substance that I could be incarerated for, which is why I'm here talking to you tionight.</span></div><div><span>man as I write this those voices are really going to ton, and I wish i cold just tune them out but I hear them just under the volme of wahtever it isI'm listening to  so for now I'm keeping the outside noises to a minimum, sometimes I do this, and I let the voices ggo, I try to push them in postive directins and it works most of the time but I n order to realy get them to speak positively I have to do very positive things, although, sometimes that makes te bastards even angrier hah, I've come to recognize that this is something that existed since I was a kid, although I wouldn'thave called htem voices bacj thn I would have called them feelings. so liek a conscience sort of is like, you imagine your grandmother catching you masturbating, then after your grandmother dies, maybe you imagine that she\s up there and sees you masturbating and youfeel shame but then, you start to actually heard you r randmother arguing ith your grandfather about why is that boy always gotta touch hisjunk??  you know that's kind of like mild psychoisis, like an anthomporufh;whatver an anthropomorphic representation of a feeling manifested in a voice that you may or may not recognize and for me, the words of the psychose are carried on the pathway of any human voice that I cannot actually distinguish the words to, like a far away conversation which is actually happening, I hear the words my brain ssuperimposes onto that voice, which is intersting becasue many times, what that voice is saying is not ven factually correct. Now why would a voice that I'm creating the words sto generate information which I know to be wrong? maybe another part of my brain is fighting it and is trying to dscredit it, man I don't know but it has brought me present to how intriicate and completely unfathomable our powerful minds really are.  not only do I create and interpret this world that we live in but our barins have several other versions of this world which we like to entertain as well, and I'm not talkong about the Marvel Univers or  the CD universe or Big Band Theory or Downton Abbey, but yes, we vreate stories in those wolrlds as well an psychisis is sort of like that, it's like haveing to watch a tv inyour head that you're not sure ins't really a monitor of what's happening nearby.</span></div><div><span>anyway, jI just want you to know thatI'm addressing this as I write this and I'll probably be affected by t Noww ehn I'm reading it you you  although I wrote that now in the then, I just felt like explaining that so the voices wouldn't make fun of me for it later.\</span></div><div><span>anyway, and I write anyway alot. because I used to do allsortsof things to avoi writing Anything a lot until I realized I was spenging wa y to much time worrrying about a word that A. really doens't do anything except to prepare you for a different though or return you to a previous one  AND was wasing a lot of creative energy so if anyway comes out, it's because I gave up caring about it for a more importatn thing. CREATIVITY and what this talk is actually about I've given plenty of talks about the previous things like addiction and writing term papers and the Marines but now I woul like to talk to hyou about wwhat we arelosing as a resultof Prohibition.</span></div><div><span>We arelosing a huge national asset inthe creative minds nd energy of our next einstein,even though eisntein came from germany, and I'm not from here, I'm thinking of humans in general when i say that we arelosing the resourceof creatinve and inventive minds who get introuble from time to time exploring alternate consciousness with whatare currently ullegal drugs. When Marijuan Became recreationally leagl in the California, the state I was living at at the time, there was like no difference really between the day before and that day, marijuana was completly accepted in mainstream society; althouhgh it can be argued that california culture though envie esewhere is hardly &quot;mainstram&quot; I've leved a lot of places and I find -oeople to be pretty much the same with a few minor cultural differences, just about everywhere I've been.. except for &quot;insert wherever you are&quot; and add a funny anecdote</span></div><div><span>make fun of their mayor or something</span></div><div><span>anyway, I woul like to be very direct and make a staement that I will support , that intro was all fun and games but I wouol like to talk about prohibition. it is my opinion and the opinion of many minds much greater than my own that prohibition is the single most corrosive type of legislation that we face today and it is iinsidious in that on the face of it, it is regulation that is ostensibly  created to torotect humans from themselves.  An interesting thought, this protecting oneelf from oneself, only it isn't ME that is writing this legislation, it is you protecting me from EMe and therrein lies the real problem you see I may not want protection.  You see I may want to explore the wild fields of my imagination enhanced by a chemical which loosens the restrictions placed on my mind by newtonian or even meta physics. I wouldlike to explore a world which has no gravity, or pain or consequence in he moment. I don't know about you but disneyland can seem really plastic after you've had a few hits omfr some really good acid. even disnelyland on acid get kind of old to be honest with you, although it would proably be way more interesting if I wasn't at dinsleyland on acid and running from the cops. and you see that right there in a nutchell is the prblem.  When you are running from the cops, it's a lot more likely thatyou'regoing to knock that guy over with the balloons or the little kid who shoots out of the bathroom, or jump a fence or inadvertently or intentionally do something that you normally would find objectionalble not because of the rug but because of the FEAR OF CONSEQUENCE which in this case we'll call the cops themselves and afterward incarcertaion, legal fees, penaltes, lots time at work, possible firing, getting kicked out of your living situation, bing homeless, haing to get a job doing illegal stuff casue you have a felony now and not only can you not vote and possibly change the system but you also can't get a job or your veteran's benfits or a hot chick cause she lookedyou up on that new ebservice that hacked everything all the way down to your birth records.CONSEQUENCE DA DA DAH!</span></div><div><span>right, full fanfare ofhorns and everything</span></div><div><span>we all know about consequence</span></div><div><span>and yet, some of us do it anyway...  Why?</span></div><div><span>it is so fucking easy and weak to just say something like, &quot;well he's an addict&quot; or h&quot;he has an adictive personality&quot; right? how may of you have described someone else or even yourselves that way becasueit's easier than actually explaing the weird shit we do?</span></div><div><span>I should see evey hand hgo up, cmon this is an interactive performance here folks, put your fucking hands up, no seriously, putyour hadsup and with your left hand pass your wallets to the stage.</span></div><div><span>pk anyway</span></div><div><span>Today we live in this world where most of us either work at with occasional visits to Disney land or we work in some really fucked up place so we can make occasional visits to disney land or whatver version of mickey runs your little hapsterwheel. right I like to ski and I like to play hockey and i like to write and I like to take drugs not even recreationally I like to take them scientifically. That is not to say I don't enjoy it or that I am sometimes out of control, because I do both BUT, the disclaimer on this commercal for drugs is that I sequester myself in a place where I cannot be a danger to myself or others. The difference between this and legislation is that I make that decision. Have I made mistakes, yes. have I kkilled anyone else, not yet. but I don't intend to... have I killed myself, Yes. once. but I was lucky in that I picked a using mate who was really good at CPR while high.  I makethis distinction because if I had been in the same situation  with say a doctor or a paramedic who was not experienced at giving CPR while high, I would still be dead, but you see my guy was high and he performed CPR on my, including a few tecniques you will not find in any AMA documentation for 30 minutes. This guy gave CPR for 30 minutes to a lifeless body and when parramedics finally found the place and administered narcan and were ready to stop, told him I was dead and he screamed at them to give me more narcan and not stop, they did so for another 5 minutes and were lifting my lifeless body on to the gurney when I came to.  Within hours of returning from the hospital there was aonother needle in my arm.</span></div><div><span>There are significant oints to make fromthis story which I haven't emphasised yet but they are central to the argument against prohibition</span></div><div><span>first, my friend called the paramedics. any addict in this room with an experience with IV drug users knows that there is a miracle in that action right there. back in the 2000's it was till true that G's don't rat. Cops lie and Junkies will let you die, (because of the first two) you see, if you called the paramedics and stayed there withthe bosy you could get charged with murder, you were at the very least going to lose your stash unless you could hide it inbetween chest compressions. Now getting rid of a stash in an emergency is an acquired artform and if this is your first resuscitation my friend, you have to make a decision. a decision usually made while , as we used to say &quot;high as Fuck&quot; so this guy, while &quot;hich as fuck&quot; on what later would be discovered was fentanyl, not Heroin. got rid of the stash, did CPR well enough to keep me from brain damage, well, mostly, then he did CPR  while high for 30 fucking minutes. Do you know what an effert it takes to do CPR alone for 30 minuts  to a guy who se welfare you[re' really concered about, while waiting for the cops to show up with the paramedics and his lips are blue and his face is getting there and you know if yo'd have listened a littlebetter you'd remember was it 5 to 2 withthe breths or can't break some bone and kill himor tsomething and oh shit, I left the smack in the spoon over there by the stove. FUCK@! right, ok, so I didn't even mention that but that's something that an addict knows and inserted in there intuitively in that story. the addicts went, Paramedics, &quot;what who called the cops? Shit you were lucky man.&quot; I mention this to point out that sometimes there are parts of the story we don't tell and that people who have an experience with a situation just add tot he interpretation. it's important because I have an intimate experience with drugs and when I talk about them, I'm trying to reate little things like that, you see any normal person would call the paramedics. any caring, sane human being under exptremem stress could still be  actually no I take that back, how many people in this room have ever made a 911 call?  how many of you made that call because you walked up on a situation and uit hadn't been dome yet?  ok  lots of you.  I looked that phenomenon iup and it turns out that in something  [find out what the real stats are]like 40% of all 911 calls, in this day and age, the person who made the call was in no wasy realated to the situation and in 8o% of those cases the person was soeone who just happneed to be walking by, asked that question did anyone call 911 and then made the call themselves. so apparently a &quot;normal person&quot; cannot becounted upon to make a 911 call if they  are in a emergency situation and not high on a drug or worried about incarceration...</span></div><div><span>so now, we have to look at what the impact of this is in the midst of the current situation which is [cite latest statistics on accidental overdose, &quot;drug related crime that doesn't include the crime of intent to distribute or selling or buying or possessing or anything related to something that takes away the right of a person to explore an altered state of consciousness in cluding paraphermalia, literature,  etc and point out 4th amendment violations which occurr as a result of  &quot;related items or prior activity which gives authority an excuse to subjugate a citizen's rights.)</span></div><div><span>we have a four fold problem here, like a table with four legs still can stand with ony three. even two if they are PILLARS , rooted, even ONE if it is strong enough and I think that the law enforcement community is on =e of those legs, rooted, a pillar and it's not all their fault. and I'm not saying this so I don't get arrested in everytown I go into, it really isnt their fault, you see this &quot;War&quot; is unwinnable.: we have a law enforcement community, you gotta go talk to a cop to understand. you gotta know that cop when he was 17 to really get it. you gotta know a cop and love him and have his respect as well in order to aks this question, &quot;Bob, WTF was that shit I saw on the TV last night, man your boys killed some dude, like WTF? I love you man but that department is out of fucking contril.&quot;  Now there aren't a lot of guys who can say that to a cop who aren't cops themselves and I thnk you probably won't hear two cops talk like that either, at least not until Internal Affairs has finished with the investigation. But you know who might be just crazy enought to say that to a cop? A forner marine, recovered alcohilis who o&quot;pccasionally did drugs&quot; of his High School realy close Cop friend who is also a former Marine... And Bob MIGHT have an answer and you both pretend that you weren't both smoking weed and dropping acid before either of you wne tinto the Corps...  haha let's keep in mind that this is a hypothetical situation of course, I mean otherwse my voices would be really haveing a meeting right now. There would definitley be calls for my impeachment and I'm not even the president of anything.</span></div><div><span>Anyway, if Bob had an answer for you it would probably be thiw, &quot;dave, man these kids are , it's not like it was when we were kifs, these kids are walking around with shit we don't even have names for yet. they got spice and ice and synthetic opiates, some of them have labs in their bedrooms brother, it's a free for all out there. someone figured out how to synthesize DMT from  wheatgrass and now we have kids putting it in a vape pen and walking into busses, man it's un believqable out there.</span></div><div><span>sounds ridiculous right?</span></div><div><span>that's because it is</span></div><div><span>and it's also how most of you people sound when you describe to me a drug which i have a lot of experience with: Coffee.  I mean we all have an experience with offee right? sometimes you have q little too much coffee and you need to go sit down in the boardroon foir a minute or in the bathroom for a minute and sometimes you don't have aenough coffee and you're ready to kill someone, and headaches and well, you tellme, what are some of the effects of not getting your fix of coffee?[take examples] have any of you ever seen a t-shirt like this one [slide of popular coffee shirts like &quot;don't talk to me until I've had my cup kind of thing] and we like to glorify coffee right, show signs stickers, clubs, vareties, yeah man, I don't know about you but I fucking love coffee. You know what goes great with coffee? Man  now I don't hardly ever do this cause it makes my breath stink and people thinkyou're kindof edgy but man, a cup of Coffee and a Cigarette, just about make my day. I mean, it's like I'm not in heaven, you know, cause you can't smoke within 15 feet of the pearly gates but Me and St. Peter are over here at the break table with a cup of sumatran soy latte with two pumps of vanilla ansharing a pallmall before we go in.  That's how I've always though t of that procession to the pearly gates you know, st peter is sitting there and it'snot he doesn't know yuo're trying to smuggle a pack of lucky strikes into heaven and all. iI mean, he was doing it back when they put three lucky strikes in every c ration. every soimgle combat casualty coming out of europe and japan lined up at the parly gates trying toget one last smoke in you know. maybe it's because I'm in the hospitality industry and I'm used to watching lines of people going in to cancerts trying oto hide a beer or a flash or a camera or whatver, now it's all on the ohone but you used to get frisked for recording equipment and cameras at concerts when I was growing up. I widsh they still did thatyou know, like no phones in the stadium.  I would like that, it might be a good idea but nobody is ever going to get away with that right? I mean you couldn't opissbly change something that everyone agrees would be better right?</span></div><div><span>or can you</span></div><div><span>whatif a bumch of people got together and decided that they were going to just make new rules and srtart a new country, I mean we'd take the ones that were obviously good like don't kill your grocer but we could write it in that is was ok if he was your congeessman too.  ok, too soon,  anyway what if a bunch of people got together an you kow, created an army out of scratch to wrestl a remote land from it's opressors and make better rules where the people actually got to decide, collectively what a grownup could do. whatif they also said, hey man we know things are going to change in the future so let's make it whereif enough of us agree, we can change those rues what do you think Betsy? and Betsy's al like, don't ask me, i'm jjust trying to make a flag, I'm good with whatever.  you know old Tommy and George and Henry and Ben and Sammy and johnny and Pat and Nate and a couple other dudes met at the old Carrpenter's Hall  when the masons weren't doing that weird Mason shit and they  came up with a plan to start our own thing. We are all out hereon this continent and all, and those cats are getting all of the money and notonly that but the king is telling us what bible to read and shit. And George is like Not in my back yeard, which was Virginis and Ben was like NIBY and Thomas was down the hall flirting with one of the interrns but they already knew whathe thoiught because he had published a couple of paoers and they were ilke OK, leetthis is our continent that we stole from the  indigenous pople so let's callithis the continental congeess of free white men who forrmerly used to reside in europa. and this little gy in the back was like cmon dude that shit is too long and so George what like, what about ontinaental congress, and there were a bunch of &quot;AYE except for John and jimmy but those two would oppose even their own motion so the little guy wrote it down and a shit ton of people died and then George, who never really like Christmas Anyway, snuck across the river while the Germans were getting drunk and BOOM USA</span></div><div><span>only, now, what we have here is a place where an adult human being of average means is subject to rules which come from an inability to solve problems that arise when a culture suffers injury as a result of compounds created  by mixing plants together and consuming them. Sorry, let me rephrase, because some mixtures apparently are OK while others are not, ostensibly because they create a prredictable effect on humans thatwe have collectively decided are unfavorable to the rest of society. I think that is the reason . I think that we've decided that iingesting certain plants or mixtures of plants and chemicals results in a cokmpound which predictably ruins lives and makes humans do things which are despicable and dangerous. I mean, that is whatit sounds like. because I think we set up this country so that a person could think anything they wanted as long as it did not infringee upon the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I mean normally you would only punish an illegal behaviorr or action, rather than punish the substance for the action f the person. meaning, a product must predicatbly and reliably cause harm to society in order for the product to be illegal rather than the action.  Don't worry, all you smartie pants debators over there who like to sit in the back are thnking, &quot;this would be agret gun control argument&quot; but we're not going there today and I do not take a stand on that when i'm talking abouthis for reasons which will make sense later</span></div><div><span>so here we go, ntice I didn't say anyway. we have some to aplace in the legislation structure of this country where through one incident or another and the resulting legislation we have determined that som compaunds are not suitable for unregulated consumption when talking about consumables.  meaning, nitrogliceryn is good if you have herat problems but we don;t want to sell i overthe countrer for otherreasons. it is dangerous to the public. people might go out and make bombs or blowoff their tongues or something.</span></div><div><span>and we have decided that certain psychoactice substances can be ingested , self regulating without a prescription butnot until you have reached the age of 21 where apparently it has been decided thathumans make good chices. at 21. before 21, probably not a good idea, i  mean you can navigate a 2000 pound vehicle through crowds at high speed and w2e epect you to have a crash or two but don't crink til you're 21  I know it sounds funny ehen you say it that way right, like if I was honestly going to pick an age whenI thought I was responsible enough to drink.. that number would probably be after I'm too old to drive. but that's just me, I'm not the most caustious person in the wolrd and just as an example because I like to talk about things that actually hapnened rather than what I think usually happens. I got my Driver's license at 17 and had my first car accident at 17 . some of you or even most of you may have had a different experience with cars. I am just saying, that insurance companies make thiese things up called Actuarian tables and they are basically lists of things that have &quot;actually&quot; happened and as a result of these tablesthey have determined that a person who has a driver's license and is under the age of 25 should be charged more than double for insurance than the rest of u. and they don't do that to lose money my friends. they do that as a result of situations wheich &quot;actually&quot; happenend. the numberswill vary as the years go on, for instance in 1989 whenI had my accident the numbers eremuch higherthan they are today, I don't know for sure but I think that has to o with therebeing much more education and safer cars and better tires, better roads, technology b or whatver but the thing that's pretty much the same is the humans under the age of 25 thing. IfI can I'll throw up some numbers that tell us a sort of truth.</span></div><div><span>anyway, bak to prohibition. and the four fold problem. We don't live in these little isolated uuniverses where identifying cause and effect is so easy. this is the lab of the real world and sometimes problems are hard to isolate and treat, like Drug Abuse. People use drgs for lots of reasons, sometimes because they feel bad and someotimes because they feel god and sometimes just because they don't feel anyting and the're not comforttable witht hat. this is reality, we all spend time in different emotional states. that's a fact, that iw life and it is just as natural to want to change that. to repeat actions which are enjoyable. now theres a weird caveat to thisbecause sometimes we're just trying to figure out how to be ok when we are feeling bad. Sometimes we can't fix the pain we have to manage it. we learn how to do this at a very young age because at a very young age we are constantly being prevented from doing the thing we WANT to do, it's protection so when we long for the ball and mommy won't let us haveit, we either cry and screwam and kick we not either, we definitley do this until it doesn't work anymore at which time we have to igure out how to be ok with not having the ball of=r bottleor being held or whatver. so this is a thing which we know from a very young age. but we don't talk about this much these days, this sitting with discomfort. prpbably because we have candycrush saga and Xvideos. there's something in that little box for everyone and you never have to be bored ever again. Now I'mnot meaning to get on a tanget=nt about thehone but thereis a silent issue here, that is the silent issue of  masochism. you see some folks learned that by enjoying pain they don't have to fearit anymore and some take that even further but the point is that we all have a little of this masochism in us, we call it the cult classic. this idea of loving something just because we've learned  to not hateit. i know, it's weird and hoefully yopu've rread about it first but it's not a huge leap to get that the quirky things we like are for a reason usually not known to us and they areusually something that most people anticipate they wouldn't like. like boris Karloff or Snoop and Martha Steward cooking together.  yoor housewives trying to destroy each other.  you see it's like we learn to love something that we almost actually hate. but it makes us different you see. it makes us special, and special is really important to us humans, evn the not specialness has a specialness in it, in codep communities they call this avoidance.  and avoidance makes you special too. like spartan warriorss or eunics, or old cowboy dudes who get to fall in love with hot 23 year olds in the movies, you see that 50 years of roaming the backwoods gave them the grizlle that got the grl, I know it never happenned but what I'm saying is that these roles get reinforced and nobody talks about them. and they are very prevaent in counterculture which is whereyou will find yourself if you you decide to embark ona consciousness crusade. </span></div><div><span>anyway, this what doesn't kill me makes me stronger syndrom thatis embracedby many is coounterintuitive to the SURVIVAL INSTINCT OF THE SIMPLE ORGANISM.    </span></div><div><span>Even goin go th e gym is a concept thathas it's rootsthere, an advance organism plans bahavior which is unpleasant for a long term benefit. we all do this, even the widely disrespected junkie who justwants the quick fix.  If any of you foks out there who have never spent a couple of years following the dead or phish think that this existence of instant gratification and jubilant carefree rambling is an easy life, you are mistaken by a very long way. The live of someone who has basically given their life over to inclus=de an addctive substanvecein our current socioeconicmic and moral climate is a hard life, I mean it's not like you're carving a path for rt 70  from denver to Salt Lake City kind of hard but, not john henry agains the steam hammer or whatvever that thing was called but the aspect of living a life which takes into consideration the accomodation of an illegal activity has significant resource drain, mental, physical and time-al is there a word for that, relating to time, the time thing, the time as a consumable resource calculation thing, I don't know what you callthat but let's just call it time management equation. Now I must add that this only really matter if you give a fuck about not getting arrested or having your life altered in a permanent egative way asa a result of a choce to explore a specific state of consciousness. </span></div><div><span>it's important to make this distinction, because people who don't give a fuck are a whole nother thing altogether and like babies and drunks seem to avoid all sorts of consquence. but they are certainly not the norm and I'm going to table that for a second but i will adress it later, the why that is factor because I think i have an actual explanation  and it has to do with how we decide where to spend out extra resources, which I call the judgement factor in how we relate to others, ourselves, the comparison and the amount of our available resources in comparison to our personal experience, it all factors out so that we hae plenty of resources to give to the entity which we have decided imaking yourself look like that entitiy is the primary focuse of a person who you may see from time to time, that is to say when they fit into your perameters you may notice a peron who is worthy of your excess, unless you  have an issue with your own worthiness in which case you will see them everywhere and you will but you wonp;t have enough to give. but that's another thing altogether we're not goign to get into that I'm trying to stay on the topoic of PROHIBITION becase it is very important the we not let all humans just indiscriminately do whatver the hll they want to do now can we? of course we can't be letting everyone else out therejust having fun and dancing and smoking joints and having sex on crack or whatver. that's just not faiir, it should be illega, hich iis for the most part how Pot became illegal if you ask me. I mean opium, benzedrine, , alchol, I can see why they are contrlled, cocaine, sure , amphetamine, ok, except for those bothersome little kids that are always running around playing with things nd stuff, wee could give them a little amphetamine and callit adderall and then we could actually get through the fucking arts section  in the morning. </span></div><div><span>I know, I know, but keep in mind I wasn't talking to th the person who has three jobs and sees their kkids a couple of hours a day, those people are busy rightnow working , I'm talking to you. so I'd like to tke this moment to re-emphasize this whole actual experience thing. If you are imagining a hard working mother of four who has three jobs and extremely limited resources and then saying to me wait, but what if, and I've seen people like this and that etc, please try to stop that thought because you don't have an actual experienceith that and it doesn't apply to you. I thinkthis is a big partof the problem because people tend to imagine the situations because they sa them on the news or they watched good times on air TV or some shit like that but the fact is that we can only interact with each other accoring to our actual exp3rinec and interfacing any other way is inauthentic and useless and a horrible waste of each others' most importNT RESOURCE , time.  YOU CAN CHANGE  IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY ALOMOST ANY ASPEC TO F YOUR LIFE OR ANYONE ELESE'S BUT YOU CANNOT PUT MORE THAN 24 HOURSINTO A DAY AND DESPITE MY MOST DETERMINED EFFORTS, YOU CAN'T GO LONGER THAN THREE DAYS WITHOUT SLEEP BEFORE YOU ARE PRETTY NMUCH BATSHIT CRAZY. and that is my actual experience.</span></div><div><span>at 2 days you're probably crazyy but noone can proveit to you. at three days the shit starts hapening that even you have to admit is just not connected with reality. I spent severl ayears in that spot man and I had to do it and it probably did some permanent damage but I was licky enough to be helpd through by some other guys who had the same experience and that saved my life.  f you are a silent sufferer of psychosis, I salute you. that's one of thos= oxymoronic things that only a suffere of osychosis would glaugh at. A silent Sufferer of Psychosis. haha yeah right, ven the voices though tt that one was funny. They always laugh at that on.  by the way, you know how I figured out that the voices were not real? I mean I sispected it but I couldn't tell i there wasn't some government entitiy secretly using me for experiments wwhere they had satelites beam doiwn soundwavs on slect eople to see if they reacted and stuff. I mean I know that sounds crazy but like, what if?it's possile it could happen and I'd bet you thowe people wouldn't believe it either so  I mean, it could be right?  you have to undestand that after three days, the other logic catchfails  or failsalfes or wahtver in your brain aren't working o fast so you allow some interesting ideas a few extra moments of validity. it's a systemic hing. anyway, I was living on this boat. it was beore I bought my own boat, I had recently become without a permanent domocile and a good friend let me stay on his boat. it was like a 55 foot motorboat, older like a criscrat I can't remmber the nam eof it but it was sort of like the boat in Jaws 1. anyway. it was moored, at anchor, I mean it was not kept on a dock it was permanently on the ball out in th ebay , so you ha to have a little dinghy to go get to it, now I was using his rib which i==stands for rigin dinfatable boat , I kno you all know thewood plak in th ebottom and inflatable sides, wel I never had a rib before and the air valves were alittle leaky and he had those cane tips you know the rubber things in the harmacy you see the rubber white or balck thing, well he had those stuffed into the inflator holes and I had decided that they were what was holding the air in, I didn't chek this theory, it juest seemed funnny so I decided it was true., and this was a pretty long row into a marshy mud field which at low tide left you with 50 to 70 yeards of sucktion mud walking., ao anyway, I had a gigig, I was tweaking a little on the boat, maybe a lot, they idn't know this but I wasn't proud o it, I was trying to get clean at the time and I had thrown al my stuf in the dinghy my bakcpak, computer, microphone, speakers couple of o</span><span>her things. tha we</span><span>re inportnt and some asshole a couple weeks earlier has stilen the other of the two oars so raher than using one big heavy wooden oar, I mananged to ind one of his kayak oars down below. and I was using that to row the boat like hawaiian style and thenI got pretty good I would actually stand up in the boat and row it ause it looked cool and I was all weid t the time anywayso I just get in the boat and the water is about 30 maybe 400 feet here. and I am still standing and I start to pade and i miss the wat er or just lipped the water and the oar goes fluing back, hits one of these cane tips and it flips in the waer and starts sinking. so everything I on is in this little boat right? and I've decided that that little white thing is what keepw the air in. and I've also decided because I didn't know, tat one hole in the rat deflates the whole rat.  I didn't know that thee nice folks over at zodiac and Avon had figured out you could put three bladdres in there and make the damn things nearly unsinkable, so I don't hesitate I jump in the water, suit flip flops, pants everything, ive righ</span><span> after the little cane tip and I'm just so close, all the way down, just touch itand t bobbles away and im kicking my feet and struggling to go faster when I realize I've hit bottom and i get the cane tip just at the timeI'm all the way at the bottom and I'm thinking, wow, I'm at the bottom and simultaneously oh shit I'm at the bottom and i look up and I'm at about 30, 35 feet. and I'm becoming present to the fact that I'm out of breath and the air is  a pretty far way up but I'm loike  &quot;no problem I'll just kick off the bottom like a pool and float up and paddle, no problem, well something about my family, the men in my family don't float for whatver reasonlI mean my youngest brother floats a little but my dad doesn't even really need a weight belt when he scuba dives, I know that's kind of werd but a lung full of air only hold me afloat for about 15 second. so I start by kicking into what, at best is a murky bottom, like I don't v=even want to put my feet in there but I kick off nd it' slike blah, I maybe go like 10 feet and so I start swimming\now here's another one of those momentw when the divers among you are going to have notices something that neither I at the time nor non divers will have thought of. and that was my ears, You see I had my hands out trying to ge the damn cane tip so I din't think to clear my pressure. fortunatley for me, my ears were worked up or whatver and teycleared themsleves a little bit to whatver that is three atmospheres or so but going up, it idn't occur ot me to release the pressure and as I reached the surface, gasping, graying out from tack of air, both of my eardrums burst open and ripped in what was one of th emost painfullittle explosinns in my head. =i don't even think you have nerves in your eardrums but whatver happened it hurt so much I wasin that silent scream, you know only i'm clinging to the side of this boar which hsn't lost aby air iand is floating quite nicely all bobing in a quiet soet of way and the air is all nice and the sin was shining and my head is screaming at me that the world is on fire. when I realized at some ppoint that I can't really hear right. i can hardly hear but wheni talk it's like the broken speaker at the drive in. </span></div><div><span>i gotthe cane tip thing in there but of course I noticed that it had really had no effect and I paddled for my gig which was a a really wawesome burlesque boutique anniversary which I got to udge after I was finished singing with a band that I coul neither hear nor see and my singing was so loud and obnoxious in my own ears that I got really sef conscious at the gig; but I noticed someting because one of my ears was really bad and the other was only kind of bad and that was that someonf the people talking to me, I could hear them equally in both ears.  I was like what the fuck? and then my sispiciouns were validated that it really must be a satellite beaming sound waves into my head.  OR that I was making them up completely which would explain, maybe why they were so fucking mean all th time and arguing and shit. and that dialogue had been shaping my experience for a year or so, like two evil sportscaster doing th e play by play on every fucking thing I did. If I hadn't had a lot of experience improvising in front of corwds it would have crushed me, I woul have become a shellshocled recluse and probably ene dup in an institution, like smeof you may be considering guiding me to now. but you see I became present to the fact that not only wasthis happenieng to me and it was because of the drug that I was keeping my self up with for weeks at atime; but a whle lot of other people h=ere having this xprience and keeping quiet about it because it is also a diagnosis for schitzophrenia. so people who feel absolutley normal and are 3eently experienceing voices in some cultures are considered shaman and wise people because there is no shamein hearing the voices and so their voices tend to be guiding and benevolent combining the unconscious and conscuious experience of the individual to saole problems, invent medicenies come up with creative solutions to societal problems but in the guy who is trying to evade law enforcement or the stigma of his fellow man, those voices are not nice, especially a gy like me who had recently relapsed just before his 7th csober birthday. </span></div><div><span>I was just beginning to have an experence which I still hae today. even sober although dininhed in both intensity and vitriol, It's like once being exposed to the way a thing works like an engine or electricity, I don't inhear the feelings that have anthromoporphed delivery methods. Eventually I sought treatmnt and that's another story that I tell to folks who have that condition but when I first met another person who had the same experience it was like  a huge weiht was lifted from me. and when I relate this story to other people I see that fear and disbelief in their eys.  when you tell some cat who thiks he's crazy that you believe him and you start sharing examples, man, that is a powerful thing. it's also one of the few things that gets the voices to be nice to me for a while. this is pretty common too, I mean you can searchonline and find tousands and tousand of support groups and people getting to her to talk to people they can see for a change.</span></div><div><span>Right now they're arguing  about whether or not I'm suitable to to remain in the public domain. these fuckers locve to talk when I'm writing, .</span></div><div><span>it's funny, they always blame it on the rugs and certainly sleep deprvation was a huge factor; but there is no way of knowing that this isntsomething that would have happenned anywa. I'm not saying they are healthy or anything but whenI talk I like to talk in reality and in reality I cannot say  that this condition might not have naturally occurred, suffice to say, blaming my pas on it is not healthy. adressing today and the future is healthy and I know because that asshole who says mean shit in a sarcastic way, he shts the fuck up when I'm writing the trth. He's just a blowhard anyway. I like to pick fights with them sometimes in case thye actualy ar real peoople on th other side of the wall. it's a game I've learned to play, you see if they are real, then they deserve to be antagonized for invading my privacy, and if they aren't real, nobody has any dea  what I'm talking about , it soesnlt matter and most of all I like the fact that they are nothing more than a whiff of smoke in an brain whose imagination is so dynamic that it can greate these shibboleth who ooffer enough resistane to keep me going. There just ins't much more satisfying thatn telling a big fat dragon that it down't exist, and secondly that all of it's magnificent attributes whichit is so proud of were actually your creation.    And if there is a big conspiracy, it's be great to be vindicated knowing that any actions I did in resposnse to this harrying ws ctually thier fault for pushing me there.</span></div><div><span>and if you like this line of reasoning, you must be so careful. because you cannot be responsible and irresponsible for he same reason. ultimately I am culpable of all of my own actns period, whcih means if I do something illegal it's because I chose to do it. and to me that is the bottom ine. You see i I breakl the law it is because I chose to. my circumstances obviously are factors but when it comes to prohibition I think that the law is flawed. Ultimately this culture of fear and consequence creates situations where otherwise normal people who wish to responsibly lter their consciousness for recreation or exploration cannot do it without it being tainted by fear and consequence. there are other consequences too, the infrastructure , the &quot;black Market&quot; which must be mintained in order to have a supply chain has been prob=ven impossible to eradicate. if 30 years of a war on drugs has shown us anything it's that drugs are winning. because people want the freedom to explore and prohibition just puts icing on the cake by gigving it a tabboo spice. prohibition enables the infrastrcture that fuels and fund the kin of people who don't follow the rules of a scoiety, which in many ways I agree, I like gibi==vinging untaxable money to free thinkers. I think that if a govenr==rnment tries to supporess an industry they should not be intitled to rv=evenue from that industry. I mean, again, here we come up against a way of thinking that has been so ingrained in us that we fail to question the validity of income tax in the first place, let along the favct that  charging taxes for revenue generated while having to circumb=vent the commercial infrastructure of the country is idiotic. if the people in this country wouldlike to enjoy altered states of consciousness (and the number =s n=don't just suggest this, that==ey prove this without a doubt) nd people are so willing to o this that they risk the US Penal System with all o its known failures and corruption, then one could safely say that the people of this country would lik eto have the freedom to utilize compounds whih allow them to enjoy alternative states f consciousness, sensuousness or perception. That Message is CLEAR. The War On Drugs has been a method for government agencies to gain power , to achieve cash flow, to embezzle siezed assets and to control the american people, to fund insurrections or support sympathetic regimes, e I'm not sayuing that this wa some somett of conspiracy  masterminded by Nancy reagen when she picked up the temperance Banner but to say that it hasn't been hijacked and utilized for other purposes wouldn't be naivety, it is straiight perjury.</span></div><div><span>anyway, four fol problem: law enforcement, criminal infrastructure, tyranny, health</span></div><div><span>Law enforcement is given the power to arbitrarily decide iif this plant or that plant can  enable them to arrest you, prosecute you etc. When the average person going about his average day can be taken hostage for what should be normal behavior by police, that is Tyranny. I told you , the cops are tyring to do a good job and protect and serve the people, theyare just like everyone else, trying to get  sjob done without enough personaell funding and the problem is bigger than they can handle, because they have to do stuff that they shouldnt be doing. they have to do so much paperwork for every time they are interacting with the public . not only that but they are tolkd to enforce legislation that I don't think they even agre with in some cases. and that sucks. meanwhile thier adversaruies have no such restrictiosn, don;t do paoerwork, save receipts (usually0 and regulations don't apply to htem. The second amendment restrictions have no bearing on a violent criminal, the instrument of deathis a human, not whatver tool was used. Guns don't kill people, murderers with intent and opportunity kill poeple. but the cop is out there standingon the corner with a huge responsibility. and the administrators of the cops can be as ruthless as any criminal. it's no secret thatthe best investigators are uncomfortably simlar to the sociopaths they are trying to protect us from. I think that's cool actualy, don't get me wrong, I'm not aginast benevolent psychopaths finding the nonbenevolent ones. I have a sneaking suspicion they think that's cool too, just like the rest of us, being special is important. the differnce is that I feel a little shame for being special, a psychopath doens't have that problem., btw that's agian oversimpliication and probably not even funny if I think aboutit.</span></div><div><span>Health, plants are regulated by the FDA for nutrition, toxicity, usability, sustainability, availability and resource demand as well as plenty of other things I never heard of. Plants are pretty amazing. the intricae relationship between plants and animals in this planet in unfathomable in its scope. as a result, agencies ike the FDA and departments of agriculture hav eto take into account the impact of a crop on the environment andas well as on the people who consume it. I have no problem with the FDA or DOA taking great pains to evaluate a compound before deciding how it can be accessed. It makes sese to me; however, plants like Marijuana have been a part of our human experience since as far back as we have written history and yet, suddenly it is not only made illegal but for a while and still in some countres cannabis is SO illegal tht it cannot even be studied, likewise with LSD, Psilocybin and DMT and other hallucinagenic compouns  which have aso been a part of many cultures' spiritual and developmental success.  To make something illegal that has been applied for millenia isn't just wrong on a personal or spiritual level but on an evolutionary level. Thes substances are in some cases estimated to be responsible for great leaps in human evolution of language, philosphy and social engineering. I'm sure there are many instanced of behavior which has also been detrimental; but, to deny access to this experience to all except ones who are willing to break the law seems criminally prudish.  I have always saw the prudish  spinster as an antiagonistic archetype,I know that many of us are not used to hearing entertaine rlike Adam Ant being quoted on a philosophical vein but he described this phenomenon nicely when he sang, &quot;don't drink don't smoke, what do you do? Subte inuendo follows must be something inside...&quot; and on the inside we seek relief, we seek excitement, we seek meaning, we seek peace and we seek security and love and purpose and sometimes we come up short</span></div><div><span>the searches and the resistance to allow certain compunds to be explored has enabled a criminal infrastructre to flourish and surely affect behavior to the highest ofices inour country. As i power is not enough, the robes o Justice  and the shoes o  legislation all have been ullied by the presence o illegal substances It is so contrary to my philosophy that the mere presence o a substance is grounds or  incarceration. meaning that no physical crie  has been committed that doesn't immediately have to do with the acquisition or caintainmnet o that substance.  You couldl by all accounts b a ine and upstanding , tax volunteering citizen when suddenly, without indicitav oractionable oense, you are subject to the immediate removal o your rights, reedom and even your reputation is subject to assassination as a reut o the mere mention o possession a a powder or lea or a liquid, or even a certain shped piece o glass or a hypodermic needle.  I ind that to be contrary to the very nature o the obvious intention that assembled the documents to guide this country.  In act i you had the mental lexibility to consider what a world might look like with addiction and its surrounding conditions in a society which viewed even heroin or amphetaine a the same way we view alcohol or xanax, as a prescribable or adult-available substance which som people abuse and are given treatment without stigma or shame, simply known to us that these substances , while enjoyable, can cause dependency and should be treated with caution.  I know I'm crazy. I know yooure thinking but all the crime and the people having sex and theoverdoses and the prostitution or whatever, I don't know whatyo're thingking, I only know thatI think that i stigma and ear and police and product purity, consistent pricing and dosage wer known and available and regulated that in that society criminals would have a really hard time making money wihtout paying taxes.I mean i you decriminalized those things, what the heck would we do withourselves, there would be no turf to shoot eachother over, there would be noorganizations raking in trillions of dollars a year to fund their machinations, they wouldn't have machinations, they'd be  trying to gfigure out how to create new forms of reneable energy and making new music that didn't usethe smae four goddamn chors. hey'd be cultivating the land and making a good living in a clean environment. Sure  when uyou reallytake a look at the crime in this country. when you REALLY look at how everything is fueled.it is fueled by the Money or other resources that a human being is willing to spend on things that keep them alive or keep them happy. If you could flexibly imagine for a moment a place where you just went and got some heroin and got high with a dose that was recommnded by the FDA, how in the hell would gangbangers and terrorists ever make a dime for their efforts? the same way churches do. Htey'd have to beg of=or it, get a constitency, a congregation, a flock, a fucking audience and I don't know about you but there is no terrorist rally I'm attending and giving 5 bucks at th door if I lived in that world.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span>Now I know, you folks are saying this thing, this phrase which in my opinion should be the only thought that the US constitution should have made off linmit, or illegal. and that is the phrase, &quot;I agree with you but you will never get them to change it.&quot;</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span>I cannot tell you how ignorant you are ifyou have ever said those words to another person. I mean a statement like that was said by every racist, every slave owner, every oppressonr of women'srights, every single emporer, laughing as the palm fronds daintily tickled his nose, every king ho stuffed his rolls of fat into leopard skins and velvet said those words . every oligarch and world banker sits chickling, it should be ther slogan on the family crests of these people, I don;t now how you say it in late but when you say Yeah right in reference to the change that everyone plainly wants and is afraid to ask for becuase why? because they don't want to hear you say, I agree with you but you'll never change it.</span></div><div><span>everytime I hear this said within earhot of a child I want to grab the adlt by the ears and yell, &quot;What is your problem? How can you be so profane in front of a thirsting mind?&quot; you are pouring the sludge of despair down the throat of each eager human, anxious to play his part in the betterment of humankind. Animal kind even.  I was laughed at a lot as a kid and I was lucky that I had a tiny little circle who didn't laugh when I was wacky. and if they did it was in mirth, net </span></div></span>
