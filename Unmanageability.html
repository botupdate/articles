Feel better. Work better. Having a better time.&quot; As ex-problem drinkers, we smile at such a sally. We know our friend is like a boy whistling in the dark to keep up his spirits. He foolshimself. Inwardly he would give anything to take half a dozen drinks and get away with them. He will presently trythe old game again, for he isn't happy about his sobriety. He cannot picture life without alcohol. Some day he willbe unable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it. Then he will know loneliness such as few do. He will be at the jumping-off place. He will wish for the end.</p></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Step 1</div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">Powerlessness<br clear="none"/>I must know that I am powerless<br clear="none"/>No human power<br clear="none"/>List some human powers, some inhuman powers<br clear="none"/>Change our goals to facilitate our behavior<div><br clear="none"/></div>Spiritual Malady<br clear="none"/>Mental Obsession<br clear="none"/>Physical Allergy<br clear="none"/>Phenomenon of craving<br clear="none"/>I am powerless over all of them<div><br clear="none"/></div>I have some powers<br clear="none"/>I have some skills and abilities<br clear="none"/>Some are exceptional<br clear="none"/>But they don't help me stay clean and sober<br clear="none"/>They don't even help me with the bedevilments</div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">Why?</div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">Dodging </div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">I went from blaming everyone  and people places and things </div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">to blaming God. </div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">I have to take responsibility to avoid Unmanageability </div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">Is easy to see that externally my life was unmanageable but you gotta get some shit together  to see my life is unmanageable internally </div><div style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans, sans-serif;font-size:16px;">How do I get past this if one is causing the other.
