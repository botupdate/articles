                <div> something about the Tipping Point I was going over these you know transitions in my life thinking about you. Transitioning from high school I giving up possibility of college or whatever going to the Marines so I'm giving up you know whatever for give up my freedom to learn how to be independent or to gain the skills to become independent these dichotomies to be strong I gave I give up my freedom to protect freedom next I gave up my security I gave up my singleness I gave up my you know being single to it for a life you know to share a life with someone else so I gave up my the options of Singularity so that I could be part of a better little team I guess I should be part of a couple and then I ended up giving that up in order to explore so then I gave it up so then I I guess they gave it up whenever it how it goes I gave up one to explore then Singularity again I gave up the security of the Marine Corps for the options of you know the possibility of entertainment and you know striking out of my own entrepreneurship and then later after I gave up my my freedom to explore numbing Mist you know I mean I gave up for alcohol and drugs so I gave up feeling in a way this isn't how it's going to come out but and then I gave up security of the drug I don't really give it up I mean going back and forth my pride for sobriety I gave up my I gave up my sobriety for humility and then giving up on Love or Whatever like not caring about losing interest in love to explore the drugs or the numbness so giving up that depth of feeling to explore lack of feeling and then giving up that numbness to learn how to die to explore death or or recognizing it is a dead end but I don't want to recognize it's dead and I want to recognize it that it's choice and the reason why is because death is not a choice so choosing to die or choosing to explore death is a false sense of power over something that no one has power over everyone's going to die so exploring the possibilities of eternal life or you know extreme health in such a way that you extend life or cheat death or talking about immortality as a possibility is your way of you know giving the middle finger to death and people do it in several different ways in my opinion like exploring the golf living death as death in life is a way for you to express yourself as though you are in cahoots with death your you have accepted it your your partner's your collaborators and that's why I think it's a goth and that feeling has something to do with the powerlessness of death in it and a reaction to the powerlessness of death in bracing it could be healthy maybe not healthy depending on the person but also exploring immortality in God and religion in old texts and vampirism or the zombie apocalypse whatever that is these are all examples of your ability to obtain a state of being that is not held Ransom by Death. So vampirism zombie apocalypse Angels eternal life God Heavens Valhalla Glory famousness all of these things touch the possibility that your name even if your Consciousness does not survive death progeny your family children in any number of ways we quickly get to this point I think in our lives where we are either cherish or relish or or give importance to this dominion over death or we recognize death and just move on and live a life knowing that it's going to end and doesn't really matter after that what you did or whether you achieved some notoriety or go to heaven or you know you escape that veil of the physical plane to some people it just doesn't matter some people that they're not even they're not worried about it and other people are at Stark Terror of the possibility that they do not exist or go on or have Consciousness after this physical body dies. I believe that certain drugs allow you to Whitney attain a state of consciousness which allows you to view that dichotomy or that relationship impartially sort of like being able to give good advice to a jilted friend because you don't have a stake in the relationship or no expectations so being in a state of mind where you have no expectations of death or afterlife so to speak you can impartially look at this state of fear or expectation and explore it but it takes a severe mental state shift like with DMT or LSD other psychotropic drugs where you are in a dream state LSD doesn't really do that for me but but DMT definitely puts me in a dream state where the laws of thought physics the physics of thought are not valid the laws are different you know you can't accomplish the same things that it's almost like you forgotten who you are and when Anna me take DMT you go back to who you were so I can wake up from the dream but yet the dream is this natural world and then you're in this other world the only difference is you're you're not fully in that world and that you're still like groggy and you don't have all the but this is my experience anyway so when I take DMT I'm in the DMT world this other universes other dimension but I haven't really fully come to yet and I don't quite remember all the rules and how they're different from my dream the difference between the two realities being like that veil of time when you're just waking up and you're disoriented to me taking DMT is a lot like being disoriented in a dimension which I formerly spent a lot of time in and still am trying to apply my quote reality my this reality as in you know let's call it Earth Earth's plane Earth's reality and I'm still stuck in that as if I when I'm in a dream and I come out of the dream and I'm I haven't quite gotten used to Earth's reality DMT to me is like waking up from the dream and the dream is Earth but I never quite get to this full Consciousness level before I slip back into Earth  I want to explore this concept a little further this slipping back into Earth or falling back to Earth instead of sleep falling back to wake but the wake being awakened is actually a dream state so like so that the term waking up actually just means coming present to the reality that exists in the Earth plane this Earth plane the physical plane in which gravity and the physics Newtonian physics are prevalent.</div><div><br/></div><div>And study and the discovery of the underlying structure of metaphysics and other theories is hinting at this Veil cuz different other dimension which has different rules in the Newtonian physical rules with gravity and the laws of thermodynamics Etc geometry geography three-dimensional relationships spatial Plains time and space as they are in the linear function apply to this week. Of understanding which is experienced in the Consciousness that we share here in Earth on this plane planet with the trees and the birds in the gravity and the magnetism and the rocks in the minerals and the atmosphere which serve as a boundary constructs might call it a cage a terrarium that contains us within it time-space linear thought and it could be set this way to be in this boundary area so that it can be explored and felt as a reference to something that's much larger or maybe much smaller or of course much something some dimension of which we cannot fathom from within the construct this bound to read situation which I believe that all of us agreed to be in some level I believe that we have all as being consented to be restrained by the conditions that are in this concept that were you know this this terrarium like I said the collective subconscious so what I was saying before is how the collective Consciousness in the collective subconsciousness I believe are so closely related basically belief is what creates these tangible things once enough of us Believe In A Thing or a thing has been presented in such a way that it is tangible and can exist that it actually becomes tangible just from the thoughts so that but by thinking of things or situations we can create either tangible items but not just tangible but also intangible so I am of the opinion that there will be a point in our development as creatures as sentient beings where we will actually create reality with our thoughts so quickly and it will reach the collective subconscious in the collective conscious so quickly that it manifests all of a sudden our reality this world this Earth that we live in will become just a big blur of everyone's you know constant thought patterns as manifested in this space.</div><div><br/></div><div>I called This Moment the moment when this transitions from a world of tangible things that we view as hard solid objects that have nothing to do with our thoughts that moment that it transitions from that state of being to a state of being where everything is fluid and constantly created in millions and millions of permutations instantly and we're actually present to that I called this turnover that switching between the two types of world but the big blur and that big blur is when you know nothing is solid anymore and that we are all just disembodied entities and souls where our thoughts actually create almost tangible or or the same as tangible objects ideas interactive things that we can interact with and interact share with other sentient beings and not proximity is not going to be a factor because proximity when you're in a theory of being there's no distance really you could be somewhat Aeneas the all places at once and no place at the same time and in my opinion this will not happen until we have achieved a state of no fear by providing or where sustenance shelter air water love these basic needs is Maz lives in Ohio a key that when we do not have the fear for not obtaining them then we may be able to achieve the state of sentient creation and sentient permutation and sentient blurring or non-physical connectedness and awareness of the connectedness. As long as you have fear and you feel the need to sequester yourself from something else or gather things that are only for yourself and not open for everyone as long as you have that fear then you will always keep yourself separate so that you can be safe you will have a boundary it'll be a sort of an armored we have a sort of a mental armor that keeps us as ego separate from everyone else because we're afraid that we won't have enough for ourselves. And what we fail to realize is that we have created all of this because our thought our brain creation ideation mechanism is so powerful that we this whole earth is whole contract everything was created out of fear so until we can not feel that fear which is going to be nearly impossible however the first thing that needs to happen is that money and all of these other substitute currencies substitute ways of protecting yourself whether it's by hoarding or whether it's by making yourself stronger or making yourself in more intelligent whatever it is until you don't require those things until that the primary importance is the actual physical time that you have as a being on this in this plane of the primary importance we won't extend our lives to the link that which they need to happen for us to really realize the power of are sentient ideation and everything needs to be at your immediate availability so that you don't feel scarcity so everything needs to be at your immediate availability so that you don't feel scarcity so that you don't feel once we reach that point then the most valuable thing on this Earth would be the time that you have here and once that time becomes the most valuable thing on the planet we will seek to increase it once we seek to increase that thing human life and a time that we have here on this plane will become so valuable that we will create our cells as in Mortal beings once we have made ourselves Immortal by technology meaning we can live forever if we want to then we will have to decide when we die or when we no longer decide to be on this Earth giving another person there chance or another solder chance to populate a human body and spend some time on this planet at that point in time is when the blower will occur because that's when we will realize that we are actually Immortal soulz and that we create our experience by are ideation okay for some this time May Come when they read this article who knows it may be at a point in time that I can't be that because otherwise I would have had it maybe I just filled out it could be possibly what it is that I still don't actually believe what I'm talking about otherwise I would be sucked up into the ether it's just disembodied sentient energy but anyway we will have achieved Enlightenment of sorts through technological advances and so treating technology as the adversary of Enlightenment I believe is a childish way of looking at technology and Enlightenment actually because I believe the enlightenment contains all things so there's a truth and that truth is that whatever it is it is and it is all so therefore saying that it will it isn't really this is like you know saying that technology doesn't exist because it was better when you know we had to like use our fingers to dig in the Earth or something like that like that cuz if Doug Earth is not as good with a shovel as it was with our fingertips and you know the people who have shovels may agree that the Earth is better when I'm stuck with his fingertips but the people with the fingertips probably aren't going to agree you know once you have to shovel the old way was cool but like while you're in the old way you want the f****** shovelman I mean he'll I want one of those Elon Musk tunnel makers you know those things if I had one of those I mean you know back before we just made planets it was so much more authentic till like ghetto car holes-in-one that already existed</div></span>
